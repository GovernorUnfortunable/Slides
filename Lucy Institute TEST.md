# Week 2: Commons as "tragedy"

January 30th 2024

---
## Hardin, G. (1968). The Tragedy of the Commons. _Science_

- Published in *Science* (Rival to Nature), a prestigious and well-respected long-standing academic journal (founded 1880, journal of the AAAS since 1900) 
- A Highly Rhetorical Essay (Nixon, 2012). 
- It is not a research-based piece: based on a talk, rewritten and cut in half (Locher 2013:XII)
- Inscribed in the Malthusian tradition: Population growth exponentially, but resources don't.

---
### Pros 1
- It offers a useful stylized model of maximized individual rationality. 
- He problematizes the relationship between populations and the environment.
- Provides useful model to argue against (about the limits of property, of self-interest, the specificity in what is governed, etc.). 
---
### Pros 2
- Pushes the argument about the "finitude" of resources, the "limits of growth," and the importance of the custodians of resources. 
	
	- The world is finite, _"Space" is no escape_ (p.1243) 
	  [c.f. plans for space colonization ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/musk-and-bezos-offer-humanity-a-grim-future-in-space-colonies/)
	- Relevance of administrative law and bureaus as expert-knowledge reservoirs (pp. 1245-6) [c.f. Dismantlement of the EPA]()
- Science and technology won't solve all of our problems (e.g., techno-solutionism or techo-optimism, prevalent these days, what Locher refers to as *Cornucopist theories* in the Malthusian debate)
---
### Cons 1
- It equates "commons" to free access. (Ostrom, Locher) 
- It reduces social behavior as something tied to biological evolution. 
- It only sees one type of institution, the State, and it seems to think of a centralized/totalitarian (?) type (what kind of state is needed to enforce "corrective feedbacks"?). 
---
### Cons 2
- It only deals with structural features (historical injustices, unequal access, etc.) as 'deviance.' 
- A specific sense of morality is deeply entrenched in the formalization of the problem: 
	- "(how should we deal with any group)... that adopts overbreeding as a policy to secure its own aggrandizement."(p.1246)
- Uses the "rational man" as a unit. 
	- Rational choice always maximizes self-interest
	- The modeled relation between individuals is of competition (not of cooperation)
---
### Cons 3
- Assumes that there is only one optimal solution and that rationality will always reach the same result. 
- As an extension of the individual rationality: 
	- Morality is presented as "one and only" 
	- Some are more 'biologically fit' to be custodians (p.1247)
- It frames debates about resource conservation, forms of property, and the state's role in a monolithic form. 
---
## Questions
1. What kind of State is needed to support the "mutual coercion" suggested by Hardin?
2. How useful is it actually to push broader discussions about the commons? 
3. What are the actual implications of the "necessity of mutual coercion" (p. 1248)? 
4. What kind of property holders and what kind of State is Harding actually calling for? (Eugenics)
5. How can we relate the model to the context (Loche) and the subtext (Nixon)?

## Feeny, D., Berkes, F., McCay, B. J., & Acheson, J. M. (1990). The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later. _Human Ecology_

---
### Pros 1
- Tests Harding hypothesis: common-property (environmental) resources tend to be overused and (eventually) depleted. 
- Presents evidence about successful vs. unsuccessful exploitation of common-property resources (p.3, p.5)
	- Exclusion of other users (rivalry) - How do you exclude?
	- Regulation of use and user (to alleviate problems of subtractability) - How do you regulate?
- Provides ideal and analytical types for common property resources: open access, private property, communal property, and state property. 
---
### Pros 2
- Common-property resources key features:
	- Controlling access can be costly or even impossible
	- Subtractability is the source of divergence between individual and collective rationality
- Addresses misunderstandings in the literature "...the assumption that common property is the same as open access." (p.5)
- Coloniality as a condition for Open Access (p.6)
---
### Pros 3
- It is an excellent exercise of meta-analysis, bringing evidence from multiple disciplines. 
- Has multidisciplinary, in the author, background and reach: 
	- It bridges authors and works in policy, environmental studies, anthropology, economy, etc.
	- Still, language and phrasing do not seem oriented to any particular field
- Establishes relations between the commons, institutions, and the market. 
---
### Cons
- The type of commons the paper addresses relates to specific communities with relatively clear geographical boundaries.
- The notion of "regimes" implies some sort of institutional arrangement/design. This can lead to the idea that commons governance is:
	- Rather stable
	- Formalized in a set of rules
- Although it bridges the commons and the market, it needs to provide more information about the multiple layers of governance and/or property that can present in holding a common resource valuable. 

---
### Questions
---
1. What happens with Global Commons? For instance, is the outer space subject to enclosure? Is the moon supposed to be the subject of mining? (Climate, biodiversity, etc.)
2. Is its focus on talking about "property" an attempt to establish a relationship between the commons and the market? What are the implications of this decision for commons without actual economic value?

## Locher, F. (2013). Cold War Pastures: Garrett Hardin and the “Tragedy of the Commons.” Revue d'histoire moderne contemporaine
---
### Pros 1

- Situates the work of Hardin in its context: "...free our reflections from the preformatted frameworks we have inherited from the past" (P III)
- Hardin's trajectory: from biology, eugenics, and population to "Sociobiology" (California as the landscape)
- Debates on overpopulation: Sierra Club and *population bomb* (1968), the effect of post-pasteurian medicine in *the South*. Migration. 
---
### Pros 2 
- Environmental movement: *Road to Survival* (1948) and Carson's _Silent Spring_ (1962), 
- Post WW2 Social Technoscience leads Manichean Sciences (P. Galison): Cybernetics, Game Theory, and operational research. 
	- Game Theoory and Op. Res. played a role in Neoclassical paradigms. 
	- Hardin: the cybernetics of competition (XIII)
	- Manichean sciences reduce problems to finite configurations proximal causalities to formulate through game theory or  cybernetics (p. XVIII)
---
### Pros 3
- Tragedy of finitude: the fatalism view of resource management (destruction, shortages); [Davis, M. (2017). _Late Victorian holocausts: El Niño famines and the making of the Third World_. Verso. --- Market process and climate processes are related. Third world results from "opening" the market and dismantling traditional commercialization schemes.]
- Biopolitics - Two Levels: 
	1. For individuals interested in exploiting a finite resource (Cattle is the technical means to extract resources but also the children of the breeder). 
	2. Harmful dynamic that drives individuals to reproduce. Ontology of the enemy. 
- Governing resources is governing (person) reproduction. 
---
### Pros 4
- The nexus with the receptions: Club of Rome (downplayed Malthus)
- The inmigration-environment link: reversal of the American "wilderness."
---
### Cons

- The way the article is built focuses on the context of Hardin's work and the intellectual genealogies and institutional ecologies that surrounded him. I would like to know more about how this connects to Neoliberal Circulation and if it does or doesn't. 
- No reference to the reception beyond the US-Europe, if any. Would love some clarification on that. 
---
### Questions
---

## Nixon, R. (2012). Neoliberalism, Genre, and “The Tragedy of the Commons.” _PMLA_, _127_(3), 593–599.

---

### Pros

- The importance of the chosen genres: Tragedy and Parable
	- Parable: succinct and overly instructive form inimical to historical specificity. 
	- A "rational man"
- I love the framing: appropriation by Neolib for privatization and deregulation (plus being published in Science)
---
### Pros
- The double standard: some are more worth of reproducing and owning than others (p. 596)
- Ostrom: decouples the tragedy from the commons
---

### Cons
- It feels overly optimistic to think that social movements will solve the state fo privatization and monopolization (because there may be nothing left to recover)
---
### Questions
- Is adding meaning layers to Scientific thought something needed to enhance relevance? What can we learn from parables in science writing? could this type of strategy be used to counterattack enclosures?
