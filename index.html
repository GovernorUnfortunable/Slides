### Cheap Personal air quality sensors
Adoption of small, inexpensive portable (and sometimes wearable), Internet-connected air pollution sensors 
constantly sample particulates and gases and produce moderately accurate, almost real-time measurements that can be analyzed by smartphone apps. Data can also be used in a crowdsourced way, either alone or with other pollution data, to build up maps of pollution over wide areas.  Cheaper portable devices that can be worn by individuals to monitor their local air quality levels, which are now sometimes informally referred to as low-cost sensors (LCS).

## Structure of the Course: a Data Workflow 🔗

### What is a Workflow? 
A structured, iterative process that supports different types of human interactions with data. Not only technical steps of analysis but also involving human and social interaction. A workflow facilitates the creation of diverse intellectual contributions including datasets, methodological innovations, educational resources, software tools, and academic publications. It serves as a framework for conducting replicable research.

## Objectives ⛳
By the end of the semester, you should be able to: 
23. Examine the **sociotechnical components** of data-centered decision-making by connecting key stages of environmental data systems. 
    
24. Assess **strengths, specificities, and limitations** in existing environmental datasets through critically assessing real-world data practices. 
    
25. Apply frameworks from infrastructure studies to examine how **environmental knowledge infrastructures shape environmental action and sustainability efforts**.
    
26. Compare and contrast the roles and **interactions of human actors, technical systems, and organizational processes** in environmental data systems.
    
27. Assess how infrastructure **maintenance challenges and infrastructural invisibility** play out in environmental data workflows and the role the play in quality and reliability. 
    
28. Integrate evidence from **multiple disciplines and epistemic traditions** to develop comprehensive analyses of environmental data challenges.

# Sociotechnical 🧑🏻‍🔧️🛰

The word **Sociotechnical** is aimed to capture how **technologies are fundamentally shaped by social interactions, flexible interpretations and historic circumstances**. This has two important implications: 
29. The **success or failure** of specific technologies goes **beyond the intrinsic technical properties.** 
30. Technical artifacts and social entities **co-construct** **each other**, along with their meaning, their sense of purpose and their deployment trajectories.

## How do we know? 🌎
### (the planet is getting warmer)
 
- He **asks**: where does the evidence come from? 
- Edwards argues that global knowledge depends on complex infrastructures (p. 18).
- Infrastructures are **networks of people, institutions, and technologies** that make it possible to "think globally." 

Infrastructures function in a **layered** and **interconnected** way:
1. Instruments, sampling techniques, and statistical analysis. 
2. Who collected the evidence? Where do they get the authority to say so?
3. How does evidence come to count as such? (data, theories, models; culture and moral commitments)

## Features of Infrastructure 🪆
Based on Star & Ruhleder (1996)
35. **Embeddedness**: Infrastructure is *sunk and inside* other structures and social arrangements
36. **Transparency**: works invisibly, without reinvention for each task
37. **Reach / Scope**: beyond single events or local practices
38. **Learned as part of membership**: 
    - Understood through membership in communities
    - Outsiders must learn it explicitly
39. **Linked to Conventions** (of practice): shapes and is shaped by community practices
40. **Embodies standards**: connects to other infrastructures through standardization
41. **Built on an installed base**: path dependency + Inherits strengths and limitations
42. **Visibility upon Breakdown**: invisible when working, becomes noticeable when it fails
43. **Modular increment, not all at once**
    - Big, layered, and complex: it changes gradually, not all at once (not from above)
    - Requires negotiation and adjustments (with other systems)

> "For us, infrastructures reside in a naturalized background, as ordinary and unremarkable as trees, daylight, and dirt. Our civilizations fundamentally depend on them, yet we notice them mainly when they fail. They are the connective tissues and the circulatory systems of modernity" (p. 9)

### What is a Knowledge Infrastructure? ⚙️ 🕸 
And how It is different from other infrastructures: 
- Creates and maintains **factual** **knowledge** (truth claims) (p. 23)
- It is **extensible** among disciplines (gateways linking fields and evidence) (p.20)
- More than just data or technology, hence #Sociotechnical 🧑🏻‍🔧️🛰
- Requires technical and social components: 
    - Enduring **communities** with shared standards and practices
    - **Enduring** organizations and institutions
    - **Physical** facilities on the ground
    - **Support** systems and staff

The study of the climate serves as a *model entity*.
- No one experiences a "global" climate directly.
- Requires vast data collection systems
- Depends on international cooperation

>"**No one lives in a 'global' climate**. Without scientific guidance, not even the most cosmopolitan traveler could perceive a global average temperature change of about +0.75°C, the amount we have seen so far. Extreme weather events — heat waves, hurricanes, droughts, floods — dominate human experience and memory, and they often create false impressions of average conditions" (p. 5)

### Infrastructural Inversion 🔺🔻

> "To understand an infrastructure, you have to invert it. You turn it upside down and look at the 'bottom' — the parts you don't normally think about precisely because they have become standard, routine, transparent, invisible." (p. 21)

### Globalism as a *project* 🗺
> "Therefore, I will speak not only of informational globalism but also of infrastructural globalism: projects for permanent, unified, world-scale institutional-technological complexes that generate globalist information not merely by accident, as a byproduct of other goals, but by design. (...) “...it is a project: a structured, goal-directed, long-term practice to build a world-spanning network, always including a worldwide epistemic community as well as a technical base. If such a project succeeds, it creates an infrastructure that endures far beyond individual careers, social movements, or political trends. This endurance itself legitimizes the knowledge it produces, and becomes self-perpetuating.” (Edwards, 2010, p. 26)" (p. 25)

## Recap: Environmental Data & Infrastructures
- <mark>How do we know?</mark> Through **layered** and **networked** **infrastructures**  
	- A **socio-technical network** (people + institutions + technologies) 
	- Specific **qualities** (embeddedness, transparency, with reach/scope, community-learned, linked to conventions, standard-embodying, installed base, visible upon breakdown, modular transformation)
	- **Knowledge Inf.** (KI): creates factual knowledge and is extensible among disciplines (gateways and entry-exit) and "regimes" of vision (Jasanoff 2017). 
- KIs are **consensus holders** that build <mark>stability, reliability, and a common understanding</mark> of how we know what we know. 
	- Developing KIs (and consensus) involves struggles that shape the ability to know (global warming, the environment, etc.)
	- Globalism is a *project* for both information and infrastructure (permanent, unified, world-scale, long-term, goal-directed)
	- Endurance (beyond careers, technical solutions, social movements, and political trends) is tied to how legitimate the knowledge is.

## Sensing and computation, their role in the making of the environment 🌳📡

## "The earth became programmable." 🧑🏻‍💻️🛰

Gabrys argues that **computational sensing technologies** don't just measure the environment; they fundamentally **reshape how we understand, experience, and interact with it.** This opens the way for new ways of engagement and inhibition. 

Things we will pay attention to:
54. An **emerging** way of organizing the relationship with the environment (<mark>program(m)-**ing**</mark>)
55. Movement from space to Earth: applications on Earth of sensor technologies 
56. New possibilities resulting from these changes (grounded, local as opposed to global, globalist efforts)

## What is Programmability? 🔗

> "Programmability, as I employ the term, has a somewhat wider use than just software or code... it is an embodied and embedded **set of operations that are articulated across devices, environments, practices, and imaginations**." (p. 12)

Three key aspects:
- It is distributed (networked and infrastructured)
- Goes beyond specific objects (software, code)
- Creates new relations (hence, a new ecology/environment)
- Shapes how we experience the world (embedded in our interactions)

## The Evolution of Environmental Sensing 🌿💽

#### 1. Satellites (Sputnik and beyond)

> "If Sputnik made the **earth programmable**, it was in part through radio transmissions that encircled the planet and created a live auditory map of a **new orbital environment.**" (p. 1)

> “Satellites now regularly monitor environmental change, tracking carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and patterns of deforestation. **Satellites** are referred to as “**eyes in the sky**” that communicate to ground stations while relaying data about and through environments, as they **watch over** earthly spaces and even **transform the planet into a digital earth**. <mark>Our understanding of environmental systems is now bound up with communication technologies that sense earthly processes</mark>.”(p. 3)

## The Evolution of Environmental Sensing 🍃📀

#### 2. Current Sensor Networks are earthly applications of those technologies

> "Environments are now monitored not just by satellites but also increasingly by a wide range of **sensors that track everything from air quality to traffic levels** to microclimates and seismic activity. Such environmental monitoring is a practice that is computational, often networked, frequently automated, and **increasingly** **ubiquitous**." (p. 3)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" data-background-color="#1A659E" template="" -->

## Programs and networked expectations ➡️
> "Distributed computational sensors monitor real-time events while collecting data on environmental conditions. (...) The ambition is that environments and infrastructure can be managed intelligently and cohesively with networked sensor data." (p. 9)

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Environmental conditions, air quality and temperature, movement of objects and bodies
- **Response**: efficient, balanced; machine or human-based; "smart" implies some degree of automation
- **Goals**: efficiency, balance, prevention, emergency response.

## Sensing & Experience 

> "...[Sensing] has to do with all the ways in which computers input data into internal calculative processes in order to output data in another form. Sensors (as more specific input devices) emerged within this computational arrangement as just one of many possible devices for inputting data into the machine. (...) Sensing is then not just a process of generating information but also a way of informing experience." (p. 11)

This means:
- Sensors don't just collect data; **they are increasingly ubiquitous** (trace data + found data + data exhaust)
- They shape how we understand environments.
- Create new ways of experiencing the world.
- Technologies are supporting **emerging** relations that are **programmed** with these technologies.

## Contrasts and overlaps ⚪️ ⚫
> Here are multiple earths, in process, programmed and in operation, unfolding through distinct environmental conditions, sites of study, and responsive inhabitations. Where global observation systems might be working toward a planetary-scale project of knowing the earth as an entire system through (ideally) linked-up data sets, in contrast multiple earths are articulated through numerous distributed sensors that as currently implemented rarely form a “system of systems,” and more likely produce discrete and localized data sets for particular purposes. 

- Global observation systems (as seen in Edwards for Climate):
	- Aim for **planetary-scale understanding**
	- Seek to **link** all datasets (gateway technologies)
	- Want to know **earth as one system**
- Distributed sensing (as in citizen sensing):
	- Distributed sensors
	- Discrete and localized datasets
	- Specific purposes under varied conditions.

## The Multiple Earth 🌏 🌍 🌎
> "What 'counts' as an environment —and Earth— then concresces in different ways in relation to the sensors sensing within distinct conditions. (...) As the planet becomes a space of newly modified connections and relations, it also joins up and gives rise to new ecologies" (p. 15-16)

- Different sensing creates different "worlds." (e.g., climatization of the environmental problems)
- Earth isn't singular; digital affordances make complexity bigger (interconnected tech, programs, etc.).
- Ecologies:
	- Parallel and distributed activities that are interconnected (electronic sensors, software, and communication networks)
	- The materialization of an object of management and **programmability**.

## Tech and environmental sense-making 🛠️ 🧰

> "The becoming environmental of computation then signals that environments are not fixed backdrops for the implementation of sensor devices, but rather are involved in **processes of becoming along with these technologies**." (p. 10)

(...) “sensing” is focused on a human subject. (...) **Sensing here is not primarily or exclusively about human modalities of sensing**, but rather has to do with distributed formations and conjunctions of experience across human and nonhuman sensing subjects, in and through environments."

## Technology & Environmental Action 

> "Environmentalism might then be articulated as a response to having monitored environments, for example, in relation to declining habitat or increasing temperatures. Or it might provide the impetus to monitor in the first place, where sensors are tuned to looking for patterns of change or disturbance, and where data is seen as the necessary resource for motivating political action.” (p. 16)

## Data standpoints
- Politics of **representing events with data** (data is not a State-only matter anymore)
- **Counting is accounting**: data compiles occurrences, frequencies, distributions, or correlations (counting) to compile and record authoritative information (account) from specific standpoints, hence seeing different things.
- Practices of authorized seeing can be organized as follows. 

| Politics <br>--------<br>Standpoint | Institutional locus | Political claim                     | Legitimating discourse | Legitimating practices |

Edwards, Paul N. 2017. “Knowledge Infrastructures for the Anthropocene.” _The Anthropocene Review_ 4 (1): 34–43. [https://doi.org/10.1177/2053019616679854](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053019616679854).

Argument: We will continue to rely increasingly on KIs to understand and manage socio-environmental challenges. The environmental data we need to do this requires a new type of infrastructure that relies on new data practices that operate in more disaggregated levels (organizations, firms, etc.). He suggests recycling data resulting from other processes (exhaust data), using data from past research, and leaning on practical sciences.

## Functions of Knowledge Infrastructures 🔬🥼
'Anthropocene knowledge’ about large-scale, long-term, anthropogenic environmental change requires:

57. **Monitor** features of interest (changes in interests)
58. **Model** complex systems to test causal relationships (tipping points, unbalance)
59. Build **long-term** **memory** of change (trends, speed of change, comparisons/benchmark)
60. All of this supports **modeling**: explain the past and help project the future (in humans and nature)

## Concepts to unpack 🗃

- **Technosphere's metabolism**: the energy flows, cycling of materials, and processing of information that support the part of the earth modified by humans (+ interaction with the earth). It runs on an ever-expanding pace, supported in speed and scope by non-renewable sources. An "environmental destructive logic" (Haff 2014)
- What **planetary boundaries** must not be transgressed to prevent unacceptable environmental change? Safe operating space (Rockström et al. 2009),  earth System targets (Steffen et al. 2015), planetary Commons (Rockström et al. 2024)
- **Anthropocene**: the start of a no-analogue trajectory of the Earth system fundamentally different from the Holocene; characterized by rising risks of triggering irreversible and unmanageable shifts in Earth system functioning (Rockström et al. 2024)

The Anthropocene brings 
- What do you think the concept of **Anthropocene** obscures? 
- What Does this mean for environmental data? 
- Do you see any relation with the standpoints proposed by Jasanoff?

## A circular view of the Data (exhaust)
- "Fourth paradigm" (theory, experiment, simulation) of science emerging. 
- What does *recycling* mean for Information Systems? Reuse, repurpose, parse** pre-existent information. 
	- Opportunistic search for patterns: big data(sets).
	- Merging and gateways (entry-exit points of disparate networks, different knowledge types, institutions, actors)
- This "data waste" comes from:
	- Byproducts of other information processes
	- User interactions (data exhaust)
	- Untapped historical data

## Applied Knowledge for Environmental Action.
* Major monitoring systems emerged in the 19th  / 20th century. 
* Cases: 
  * **Monitoring Networks:** 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty (global radionuclide monitoring + seismic and atmospheric monitoring networks)
  * **Geophysical modeling** Climate Science <-> Nuclear Weapons: 
	  * Nuclear tests helped to understand the atmosphere dynamics (e.g., models from fallouts from weapons tests helped monitor and forecast the Fukushima Plume)
	  * Climate models: nuclear weapons' power to annihilate life on earth. 
	  * Supercomputers used for nuclear warfare support climate modeling. 
  * Ozone hole detection (global monitoring)
  * IPCC / UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (a model for global scale): 2015 Paris Agreements.

## Downscaling Knowledge

* Global knowledge translation **challenges**:
  * Difficulty converting global insights to local action. 
  * "Downscaling" knowledge (e.g., contribution of CC to weather events, actionable inputs at national/local scales)
  * Multi-scale approaches: integration. 
* IPCC serves as a model. Limitations:
  * Top-down, globalist approach
  * Comprehensive review process (comment round and responses, editing, etc.)
  * Challenge of Local Relevance

## Databases, memory practices & knowledge for the Anthropocene

Bowker, Geoffrey C. 2008. “Databasing the World: Biodiversity and the 2000s.” In _Memory Practices in the Sciences_, 1. paperback ed, 106–37. Inside Technology. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.
 

Argument: Retaining, accessing, and reordering the past requires memory devices as well as memory practices; both lie at the center of the transformations in the ways we know and understand the world. Our discourses about the past are connected to available information-processing technologies. In biodiversity, as in other environmental-related research areas that want to make sense of the past to understand what expects us, "databasing" implies representing, engaging while meditating, and understanding the past.

## Thinking about the past 🏺🕰
- An *inescapable time* transforms things. As time goes by, past forms become inaccessible. 
  *[The Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata)*
- Our access to the past is "mediated." To "stop" time and be able to access history, systematization and standardization are a must. 
  *Plant Fossil records*
- Life outside human societies transforms "away from labels", while life inside "transforms towards them" in the hope of relief or advantage.
  *Mary Douglas*

## A globalizing "we" and the power of classifications 🗄🗂

- Enacts the nature/culture divide (raw, wild vs. civilized) -> **ethnocentric**.
- Privileges **units that can circulate**: quantifiable and standardized measures.
- Reduction of the complex to **discrete units** (Newtonian space-time).
- Contrasts other ways of knowing (practical knowledge) and being in the world (hierarchies).
	- e.g., in English, only 30 percent of words are verbs, but in Potawatomi, 70% are verbs (Robin Wall Kimmerer)
	- [The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truth_of_Fact,_the_Truth_of_Feeling) on organization, accuracy, perception, and forgetting (Ted Chiang). 

> "...[there] is enormous power in being able to read the past, to tell the generations (Bowker 1994), and we are <mark>seeking to colonize the past just as we (the globalizing “we”) are seeking to colonize the present</mark>.” (Bowker, 2008, p. 108)

> “...we find the ability to order information about entities into lists using classifications to be a <mark>contemporary key to both state and scientific power</mark>” (Bowker, 2008, p. 108)

## Memory Practices & Knowledge Organization 💭
> "Databases are not a product of the computer revolution; if anything the computer revolution is a product of **the drive to database**" (p.109)

- Memory has become cheaper over 200 years.
- Memory "teases apart threads of memory" as:
    - "Remembering what happened" and
    - "Making present again" (p.110)
- New storing capabilities allow new types of memory practices, socially and institutionally (engaging with, creating, and maintaining this memory). 

> “Memory **prostheses** have multiplied around us; **memory devices are legion**; memory practices have been organized on massive scales: we now hold in the global memory details of events hundreds of thousands of years ago; masses of detail about lives in the twentieth century; countless photographs, tapes, diaries, souvenirs, memorials.” (p.110)

## Standards & Infrastructure  📄 🧑🏻‍🔧️

"Working infrastructures standardize **both people and machines**" (p.6)

Key points:
- “There is no simple break point at which one can say that communications protocols stop and technical standards start.” (p. 113) 
	- e.g., adaptation of writing practices to e-mail technologies, Mary Douglas quote, census and people becoming "like" their categories (reified). 
- "Strings of bits traveling along wires are meaningless unless there is a shared set of 'handshakes'" (p.113)
- (Positive) Network externalities drive adoption: "If five thousand more people buy telephones... my phone is suddenly much more valuable" (p.114)
	- *De facto* standards gain and hold this position through positive externalities (QWERTY, MP3, PDFs)
- "Standards setting is a key site of political work" (p.114) 
	- Why? Coalitions, negotiations, power struggles?
	- Examples: Mobile Com (GSM, 3G, LTE, 5G), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (802.11 series)

## Infrastructure development 🏗 🔗
### in data storage and management.

- **Key elements**: “Infrastructural development and maintenance requires **work**, a relatively **stable** **technology**, and **communication**.” (Bowker, 2008, p. 114)
- **Work**: resources (time, skills) for implementation (e.g., 1920s, the advent of microfiche, the end of the book)
- **Tech**: nothing guarantees the stability of vast datasets (infrastructuring does not mean a long life). 
	- Stability has different layers. 
	- Database architecture, storage capabilities, organizational practices 
- **No storage medium is permanent**: changes in database structures, storage capabilities, and organizational practices affect data traceability, readability, and usability.

- **Communication**: interoperability is the key to integration with established computing environments. 
	- **Metadata** (data about data): provides context for something to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and replicable. 
	- **Standard** criteria (names, fields, measures, etc.)
	- Immediate **usefulness vs. preservation** (e.g., patient diagnosis vs. death certificates)

## Knowledge Control & Database Politics 🔐

"By control of knowledge, I refer to the question of who has the right to speak in the name of the science" (p.118)

- "local ecological knowledge... is practice-based, has its own intricate weaving of knowledge about the environment, religious belief, and mythological expression, and cannot be easily conjured into a form that can be held on a computer" (Padel 1998)
    - Knowledge (about the environment) is part of a way of being in the world, interlocked with "religious belief, and mythological expression."
    - Storing is making decisions on what to preserve, how to measure, and priorities. 
- **Ownership** determines who can legitimately speak "in the name of science." (e.g., Maxar satellite images)
- New data capabilities novel forms of knowledge control.
- Third-party companies aggregate data into marketable forms (e.g., Palantir)
- Privacy concerns arise from distributed information sources: “...we have little expertise as a culture in dealing with highly distributed information sources” (Bowker, 2008, p. 118)

## Evolution of scientific archiving and data sharing 
64. **Immutable mobiles**: scientific papers are the "archive" (names of journals: *Archives, Annals, Proceedings*)
	- Hypothesis (argumentation by authors)
	- Data supporting the claims
65. **Last 40 years**: databases are an end by themselves ()
	- Theory-neutral repositories, spread across disciplines, raw data, reusability.

## Archives for Planetary Management 🌍 🏛

> “Michel Serres (1990) points out, we are now as a species taking on the role of managing the planet as a whole—its ecosystems and energy flows. **We now see nature as essentially only possible through human mediation**. We are building working archives from the submicroscopic level of genes up through the diversity of viral and bacterial species to large-scale floral and faunal communities and the mapping of atmospheric patterns and the health of the ozone layer. There is an articulation here between information and theory, but **the stronger connection is between information and action**... In this new and expanded process of scientific archiving, data must be reusable by scientists.” (Bowker, 2008, p. 128)
- Planetary scale. 
- Database Federation: a variety of data sources.
- Action: policy recommendations, decision-making processes. 
- How to manage all of this?

## Data Management Challenges 💾  🗃

"The problem of what data to retain... is a metadata problem" (p.130)

Crucial Issues:
- Longevity of environmental data is determined by **documentation** and **metadata**.
- "No storage medium is permanent" (p.116)
- "You always have to know some context" (p.117)
- How do you deal with distributed databases?
- How do we ensure data (resources, work, opportunities) is not lost?

## Archival practices *accounting for life* 📚🦋🌳
### From Human to Digital Memory

- Linnaeus: 18th and 19th century; genera names made for memorization purposes; universal, distinct, literally meaningful. 
- Field guides: "Earliest books ever printed were field guides for naturalists."
- Species classification: Memory for genera, books for species (information could not be kept in the head; books taken into the field).
- Digital era: Flexible, multifaceted classifications

- Multifaceted systems for viruses
- Flexible parameter-based disease classification
- Object-oriented databases: "Redefine basic operations on the fly"
- GUIDs and "barcoding life"
- Cutting down collections.

"This database-driven approach to the history of life is complemented by extended uses of the metaphor of computers and their programs in the historical sciences. Life is described as itself a program, with DNA being code. (p.134)"

## Retaining and reordering the past

- *Clock*: industrial and bureaucratic era, regular chronology. 
- *Computers*: life is a series of *programs* (instructions) in sequence, a set of generative algorithms. 
- Now, we can **reconfigure the past**:
	- Same kind of information technologies in different disciplines. 
	- Same steps taken logically *within* each specific discipline. 
	- Technology is making inter-disciplinary work possible, but also to have separate stories for each discipline.
- The framing of the past results from an ecology (inter-relation of components and relation to their surroundings) of memory practices.

- Data Collection happens without *on-site observation*: satellites, aircraft, drones, and sensor networks. 
- Used in Earth and Geophysical Sciences (also for commercial, economic, planning and humanitarian uses)
- Data Processing: high-performance computing, storage systems, networked infrastructure.
- Key Infrastructures: GPS/GNSS networks, weather satellites, earth observation systems, communication networks.

## Competing Infrastructures

Benson, Etienne. 2012. “One Infrastructure, Many Global Visions: The Commercialization and Diversification of Argos, a Satellite-Based Environmental Surveillance System.” Social Studies of Science 42 (6): 843–68. https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312712457851.

This article presents a thorough sociotechnical description of the evolution of a satellite system, presenting its socio-technical trajectory. Different visions of the global environment, as a volume of flows and as a web of life, from meteorologists and wildlife biologists led to varying requirements for a satellite-based environmental data collection and location system. The divide was not absolute; technical improvements allowed overlaps, collaborations, and porosities to emerge over time (animals as sampling platforms).

## What is Argos? 🛰 🛟🦩

- Tracking service and telecommunications hub that collects data from sensors in 'platform transmitter terminals' or PTTs
- Only satellite-based data collection and collection system for environmental applications
- Technically simpler than alternatives 
- Instead of a set of Eyes *sleeplessly watching the earth* (Argos), it is "a set of very sensitive ears that monitor the positions" (p. 844)

## Key User Communities 👥
69. **Initial phase**: Meteorologists & oceanographers
> "The meteorological community was Argos's dominant user group" (p. 850) "Argos's management took several steps to meet the demands of the meteorological community for reliability, accuracy, precision and standardization" (p. 850)
70. Wildlife biologists emerge as key users.
> "This situation changed in the late 1980s, when a number of animal tracking studies began to collect significant amounts of usable data with Argos" (p. 855)

## Key User Communities 👥
71. Environmental researchers
    > "After 1986, in its quest to maximize users and income, CLS increasingly opened the Argos system up to explicitly environmentalist applications." (p. 857)
72.  Different needs and practices
    > "The difference between meteorologists' and wildlife biologists' methods and goals corresponded with the relative value they placed on reliability, precision and standardization, on one hand, and flexibility and miniaturization, on the other." (p. 854)

## Competing Infrastructures & Sociotechnical Evolution

- **Infrastructures as consensus builders**: it shows how "...multiple visions of the global environment can be and often are implemented within a single infrastructure." (p. 846) 
- **Community dynamics**: the change in platform governance meant a shift from meteorological uses to include multiple users. 
> The turn toward privatization of research and development in the 1980s... neoliberal approaches to governance gained in popularity, and technocratic varieties of environmentalism became institutionalized" (p. 860)
 - Infrastructure shapes visions  
> "Just as global environmental visions have shaped the development of infrastructures of environmental surveillance, so have those infrastructures, in turn, shaped scientists' global visions." (pp. 860-861)

## Priorities, Tensions & Technical Configurations 💬 ⚙️

- Meteorologists' priorities
    > "Meteorologists and oceanographers privileged reliability, accuracy and standardization and were willing to tolerate relatively large and heavy transmitters to achieve those goals." (p. 852)
- Wildlife biologists' needs
    > "Unlike meteorologists, wildlife biologists did not place a particularly high value on standardization" (p. 854)    
- Initial certification process
    > "Manufacturers met these standards through careful engineering and testing and by setting lower bounds on the minimum weight and cost of individual PTTs" (p. 850)
- Post-1986 adaptations
    > "'Diversification' became their key word. CLS pursued diversification by offering special services to communities of new users and by loosening standards" (p. 859)

## Takeaways 🕸

- **Changes are not designed**: proven links between climate change and biodiversity loss, smaller trackers (PTTs) but also more robust and more capable. **Argos as a platform for collaboration.** 
- Animals as ecosystem links:
> "The migrations of birds, whales and other far-ranging animals were the threads that linked disparate ecosystems together into a cohesive whole." (p. 853)
- Integration of visions:   
 > "Biologists continue to conceptualize the far-ranging animals they study as living links between ecosystems, but they also see them as components of a global grid of sampling stations." (p. 860)
- **Infrastructures** as **enablers of co-construction**
  “Just as global environmental visions have shaped the development of infrastructures of environmental surveillance, so have those infrastructures, in turn, shaped scientists’ global visions.” (860-1)

## De-universalizing technology:  the case of remote sensing  🌌

Bennett, Mia M, Janice K Chen, Luis F Alvarez León, and Colin J Gleason. 2022. “The Politics of Pixels: A Review and Agenda for Critical Remote Sensing.” _Progress in Human Geography_ 46 (3): 729–52. [https://doi.org/10.1177/03091325221074691](https://doi.org/10.1177/03091325221074691)

The article provides us with a critical account of the historical trajectory of remote sensing technologies, going from military development to commercial applications. It presents a political economy of satellite imagery in its production, access, and use. Within the context of satellite imagery, it presents an example of the tensions between global perspectives and local knowledge, as well as a path for starting a dialogue between grounded perspectives and those from above. It calls to question notions of a hegemonic, undifferentiated, and objective satellite gaze and sees satellites as an inescapable earthly technology.

## Remote sensing as an Earth Observation Technology 🗺

>Satellites represent political technologies designed initially to surveil processes within and **beyond a state’s territorial borders**, from land cover change to missile build-ups. Their optical instruments allow militaries and command centers **to replace “direct sight” with cinematic “telescopic sight” and “attend in real time to the images and data of a planetary conflict”** (Virilio, 1989: 1).

- See-through borders
- Replace direct sight with telescopic sight
- Real-time data

## Remote Sensing: Fundamentals 🧱

- **What is it?** What does it do?
	- Measure objects from a distance.
	- Scan Earth's surface via optical sensors.
	- Produces 2D spatial grid imagery (flattens). 
	- Detects and reflects radiation at various wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.
	- Provides clear and accurate documentation of things that happen on the ground.
- **Interpreted** by machine (data pipeline) or by humans (data workflow)
- Some **applications**: environmental monitoring, human rights research, disaster assessment, migration tracking, agricultural assessments, etc.

## Critical Remote Sensing: what is it? 🛰️ 🌍

**Remote sensing represents more than just technological capabilities** - it embodies power relations, political choices, and ethical implications.

> "Despite the **neutral aesthetic of satellite imagery derived from its photogenic quality, its production and analysis are deeply political**." (p. 731)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#8aa2a9" template="" -->

## Power Relations in Observation 👁️ ⚖️

Remote sensing involves fundamental inequalities:
> "Remote sensing involves an unequal distribution of resources on both the supply side—those who produce satellite imagery, historically government agencies and now commercial firms—and demand side—those who analyze and use the data for a range of purposes." (p. 731)

Most critically:
> "As has become increasingly clear in an era of widespread electronic surveillance, even the mere process of being 'seen' can be perilous to certain groups and individuals." (p. 738)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#8daeab" template="" -->

## From Global to Local: Testing Accuracy 🔍 📊

The challenge of ground truth:
> "Remote sensing studies of [land use and land cover change] LULC have also made significant headway in testing the accuracy and relevance of spaceborne measurements against local observations" (p. 738)

Local classifications often "diverged significantly from dominant state-centric frameworks, which reinforce colonial models of ecological management" (p. 738-739)

## Limits of the Satellite Gaze 🌆 💭

The paper challenges the assumed omniscience of satellite imagery:

> "She demonstrates how while remote sensing provides overviews of large scale processes, which it tends to explain with 'macro-economic, demographic and agronomic correlates', it is less adept at incorporating socio-political and historical dynamics, especially at the sub-regional scale" (p. 739)

Integration needed:
Combining satellite data with ethnographic fieldwork represents a "logical methodological advance" (p. 738)

## Technology and Local Knowledge 🏫 🤝

Empowerment as a guiding path
> "Efforts are under way to empower historically marginalized communities to use, analyze, and interpret satellite imagery in pursuit of their own objectives, through both collaboration and direct training in remote sensing skills and techniques" (p. 739)

Example (Sámi people)
> "In northern Sweden, Sami reindeer herders felt that the forest sector had a monopoly on holding and presenting information, while they had 'no access to tools for sharing their knowledge about their land use needs'" (p. 741)

## Public Engagement and Expert Responsibility 📢 

Expectations for future uses and interpretations:
> "Satellite imagery is becoming part and parcel of everyday activities ranging from navigating to reading the news, and its veracity is going less challenged." (p. 744)

The field is responsible for:
> "The ability to use satellite imagery as evidence—even one that is partial and flawed, like any source of knowledge—depends on the abilities of geographers and scientists to clearly explain its usefulness and limitations to the public and decision-makers alike" (p. 744)

- **Contrasts and connections**
	- Environmental "Sensing": space to Earth Transition (Gabrys 2016)
	- Global ↔ Local: Infrastructure intersections. 
	- Environmental Data "grounding" in local contexts. 
- **Today's focus**
	- **Sociotechnical** dynamics in participatory projects: the role of tools and technology in CS projects. 
	- Citizen Science (CS) and **data gathering** (practices, limits, implications)
	- Downstream effects of CS and **networked dynamics** (data, governance, activism)
	- **Organizations and institutions** in CS projects
	- Community **participation** in CS projects

## Citizen Science in Environmental Monitoring 🎛 👓
- **Community-oriented data-collection processes** engaging with **non-professional scientists**. 
- Focus on natural resource extraction, ecosystems, biodiversity, and pollution. 
- Acknowledges the **experiences** of communities burdened with pollution (marginalized). 
- **Provides a voice** to **legitimate claims** and enhances participation in decision-making processes. 
- Deals with and points towards "**data gaps**" in the environmental and health status of communities. 
- Provides **inputs** for institutionalized data practices and law enforcement. 
- Challenges **environmental injustice** (e.g. denials of environmental health problems) 
- Deals with **diversity**: not all participants have the same skills/capabilities.
- Awareness: it **connects people with their environment**, doing surveys and asking questions. 
- It **connects communities among themselves** to address broader-scale environmental problems.
- There is **no "one size fits all"** design.

## Participative Knowledge Infrastructures 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 🤲 
 
- Participation makes networks supporting knowledge infrastructures more **robust**.
- Provides a **type of knowledge** about the world that is **grounded** (situated, experience-related, shaped culture and relations, informally transmitted). 
- Features of infrastructure are present in Community Science Projects:
	- **Transparency:** what critical components are *transparent* (not seen when used, and there is no need to reinvent them for each project)?
	- **Installed base**: What is the installed base that allows these efforts? What *inertia* did you see in organizations, people, and tech?
	- **Reach / Scope:** How does it go beyond single events? 
	- **Membership:** How are the organizational arrangements and artifacts connected to those that play a role in learning and community-building?

## Environmental Justice (EJ) ⚖️🌿

> (...) [Environmental Justice cases] involve situations where **environmental burdens fall heavily on a group already structurally marginalized** by virtue of race, gender, indigeneity, class, and/or rurality. They also feature contests over knowledge: what are the effects of pollution or industrial operations on the environment? On health? How should they be determined? **Whose knowledge is credible?** (...) worldwide flows of knowledge, expertise, and technology structure environmental injustices.” (Ottinger et al., 2017, p. 1029-30)

> “(...) understanding **inequity** with respect to the environment that includes the **distribution of hazards**, participation in **decision making**, and recognition of both **cultural** **identity** and the unique **knowledge** of marginalized groups.” (Ottinger et al., 2017, p. 1030)

## Interconnected components of EJ ⚖️🍃
- **Distributive Justice:** environmental burdens and benefits should be shared equitably.  
- **Procedural justice:** the right to participate in decisions that affect their environment. 
- **Recognition**: acknowledging the cultural identities of groups that are on the margins of society (but on the frontline of the impacts).  
- **Capabilities:** the right of every group to the conditions for a good life.  
- **Epistemic justice:** provide testimony about local environment conditions, "recognition not just for their cultural identities but for their identities as knowers” (Ottinger et al., 2017, p. 1032)

## Data acquisition in environmentally impacted communities

Kimura, Aya Hirata, and Abby J. Kinchy. 2019. “Chapter 3. Investigating the Impacts of Fracking.” In _Science by the People: Participation, Power, and the Politics of Environmental Knowledge_, 47–76. Nature, Society, and Culture. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press.

This chapter presents the case for environmental monitoring as a critical tool for environmental justice. Introducing different cases connected to the development of the shale oil and gas industry presents us with a range of approaches that citizen science projects use to address the inequitable distribution of benefits and hams in fenceline communities connected directly to these activities. It presents how data-gathering activities and the building of community-oriented Knowledge Infrastructures can help disenfranchised residents have a say in the development of extractive projects.

## The Marcellus Shale Case 🛢⛽
### Context & Response
- **Started in 2004:** Marcellus Shale (1/3 US Gas production).
	- New York bans it, and Pennsylvania embraces it.
	- Rapid industry growth. Pennsylvania: 8x growth 2010-2015
- **Limited oversight**: state agencies lacked resources for water testing (10,000 complaints in a year, 4,108 water-related). 
- Proximity to residential areas. 
- The community responded through monitoring programs (+/- 12 by 2012). 
> “Pennsylvania’s environmental regulators lacked the staff and resources to fully respond to public demands for fracking-related water testing. Realizing the shortage of resources, regulators themselves sometimes encouraged people to participate in volunteer water monitoring efforts to answer the questions that concerned them.” (p. 52)

### Collaboration with scientists 🧑‍🔬🥼

- ALLARM (exp. w/ acid rain): Monitoring
	- Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 
	- Experience with Watershed Associations (1950s; acid drainage from mines). 
	- Protocol for Marcellus Shale water quality monitoring: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and conductivity as “**red flag**” parameters for possible contamination. 
	- Trained volunteers.
	- Created data reporting systems: baseline data.
- **Standards**: protocols, data validation, expert-participant collaboration.

## Monitoring with a goal
- [Louisiana Bucket Brigade](https://labucketbrigade.org/)
	- **Community-based** air sampling.
	- Focus on **volatile** chemicals.
	- **Goal**: support a case for the health effects of refineries. 
- [Speck](https://www.specksensor.com/): real-time measurement of particulate air matter
	- Created "data stories" from observations: interpreting and storytelling.
- Public Lab: DIY environmental monitoring (photographic paper to detect hydrogen sulfide).
- Blast Zone Map: reroute oil trains.
- **Good enough data**: with purpose, meaningful for a community, shifts focus to what is *enough* to detect patterns, challenges hierarchies, and enables participation.

## Dilemma 1: The Volunteer Factor
Projects resort to volunteers; this impacts data in its nature and coverage. 
- **Participants are volunteers:** 
	- It affects the nature of the data you can collect (+ lived experiences; - consistency)
	- Uneven geographic **coverage**
	- Cultural / socioeconomic barriers to participation (available skillset, education)
- **Impact on Data**
	- Coverage gaps in disadvantaged areas
	- Bias in data collection: geographical, socio-economic
- **Standpoints** (Jasanoff 2017)
	- Everywhere (*experts*): inclusive of all affected positions, reason.
	- Somewhere (*witness*): personal injury, authenticity.

## Volunteering as "installed base."
- Context: 
	- 1950 and on: local concerns
	- 1972: Clean Water act
	- 1980s: volunteers seen as a supplement
	- 1990s: vols. low-cost data source (for cash-strapped agencies)
- **Citizens' Volunteer Monitoring Program (CVMP)**: state-run project started in 1996 and closed in 2009 (budget cuts). 

> “When the potential impacts of fracking became evident, **these groups had the knowledge, experience**, and organizational skills to jump into action, seeking funding for fracking-related projects and training new volunteers to be water monitors.” (p. 62)

<mark>Maintenance is a critical issue, also in the social side of infrastructures.</mark>

Monitoring models are shaped by problems of earlier decades:
> "...when one form of environmental monitoring becomes established over time, it is tempting to respond to new problems with those same tools and knowledge." (p. 64)

## Dilemma 2: Credibility & Neutrality
### The Credibility Challenge
- Tension between activism and scientific credibility
- Questions of bias and neutrality
> "...any scientific claims they made might be perceived as biased if they appeared to have an antifracking agenda. How much time and emphasis should be placed on establishing the credibility of their scientific claims? Would taking a neutral stance bolster the credibility of their scientific work?” (p. 65)"

### Connection to Agnotology

## Dilemma 3: Contextualizing Data
Decisions are made on scientific assessments of risks and benefits. 
73. CS can help ordinary people to participate in regulatory processes. 
74. Focusing on proper scientific collection can diminish the transformative power of CS. 


> "Citizen science projects that build on the knowledge of affected communities [...] may be better suited to identifying the unexpected issues."

### Environmental Justice
> “Citizen science could be a powerful challenge to these forms of environmental injustice, particularly if it creates opportunities for participants to advocate for themselves and their neighbors.” (p.69)
- Erie (Co.): a well 1,500 feet from two elementary schools. 
	- Buckets (LBB): sample air quality in other gas wells.
	- **Question** "safeness" of fracking: found hydrogen sulfide and silica dust (high levels)
- Affected communities actively involved with research design empower their experiences and knowledges. 
- CS goes beyond the technical and quantifiable.

## Dilemma 4: Scale & Governance
### Multi-level Challenges

- Trade-off: "Fine-grained" localism vs. "big picture" (impact of shale gas on environment and public health)
- Monitoring is one piece in the more extensive set of problems. 
- Connecting data across scales is challenging: it goes beyond the scientific.
- Gas producers and CS projects operate at different scales. 
	- Industries resist local governance. 
	- Local interests cannot face overall harm. 
- In CS, advocacy skills and scientific skills are deeply entangled. 
> “Citizen scientists are not only observers and stewards of their local environments; they constitute a political force for policy change at multiple levels of governance.” (p. 74)

## Community Science Organizations: Automation vs. Participation 🤝💧🤖 
### The Case of Water Quality Monitoring

Jalbert, Kirk, and Abby J. Kinchy. 2016. “Sense and Influence: Environmental Monitoring Tools and the Power of Citizen Science.” _Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning_ 18 (3): 379–97. [https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2015.1100985](https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2015.1100985).

This text focuses on how technology can impact participation in Citizen Science projects. I present the case of water quality monitoring practices and technologies to test a rubric to evaluate the implementation of these technologies. They manage to show how automated sensing technologies not only affect the way we "sense the world" (Gabrys) but also have the potential to reshape how communities participate in environmental governance by enforcing specific assumptions about valid knowledge, participation in scientific work and influence in environmental governance.

## Introduction

- **Environmental organizations** face a key choice: how to design and deploy sensing tools for non-professionals? 
	- Recruiting volunteer citizen scientists 
	- Incorporating automated sensor-based devices 
- Technology design reflect assumptions about users and use. 
> "Monitoring **technologies are an important part of citizen science,** and their **design reflects assumptions** about their **users** –often volunteers or environmental advocates– and about the **use** of science in environmental politics" (p. 380)

## Data Quality ↔ Participation
### Key challenges 

75. Data Quality:
> "Data loggers also structure the work of monitoring organizations in particular ways [...] adopters of data loggers are more concerned with getting good data than promoting citizen participation in environmental politics." (p. 388)
76. Community Engagement:
> "Beyond the production of data, projects that emphasize high levels of participation can produce engaged citizens who come together through water monitoring and mobilize politically." (p. 393)

# A Rubric for Evaluating Monitoring Devices

Three key dimensions:
77. Resource Compatibility & Sustainability: 
*“To What Extent Are Environmental Monitoring Devices Compatible with the Available Resources of Communities in Which They Are Deployed, and Sustainable after External Initiators Leave?”* 
78. Technology's Shaping Participation: 
*How Do Environmental Monitoring Technologies Shape the Work of Monitoring and Arrangements of Nonprofessional Participation in Scientific Research?*
79. Interaction with Regulators: 
*In What Ways Do Environmental Monitoring Devices Facilitate Interactions Between Nonprofessionals and Regulators, Such That Concerned Citizens Can Shape or Contest Systems of Environmental Governance?*
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#f9844a" template="" -->

## 1. Resource Compatibility & Sustainability
**Cost barrier:**
> "A single data logger may cost $1300, while the same amount could fund monitoring kits and training programmes for dozens of volunteers" (p. 389)

**Expertise challenges:**
> "...nonprofessional groups often lack the expertise to wade through data to identify pollution events and tease out longer-term trends" (p. 389)

**Effects on organization's work**
> "...[paid staff] find their roles increasingly defined by the logistical tasks of managing technologies that fail to support their watershed studies. (...)a specialist recently told us, ‘I have personally **fallen out of love with the data logger**.’ (...)
> **They take an enormous amount of staff time**, they require an enormous amount of travel, in terms of getting our people out there to download the information, and I find that the time-lag in getting the data often times is so great that it keeps you from, you know, identifying a potential issue."(p. 389)

## 2. Technology's Impact on Participation
Benefits of automation:
> "...sensors are set to **monitor at 15-minute intervals**. A staff member or volunteer then retrieves the data logger, plugs it into a laptop, and downloads the data every few weeks.” (p. 387)
> "Chapter members felt the loggers did a better job of monitoring and freed up time to work on other conservation projects." (p.390)

Engagement costs:
> "Many see **problems with removing volunteers from the process of water monitoring**. Replacing volunteers with data loggers can close down opportunities for nonprofessionals to **ask questions that are ignored or overlooked by experts**" (p. 390)

Specific technologies do empower participants and improve: 
> “Through bucket monitoring, citizen activists were able to amplify their personal experiences of environmental pollution and make their grievances heard.” (p. 383)

## 3. Interaction with Regulators
Standards provide **data legitimacy**:
> "These examples suggest that data produced by citizen groups using loggers is taken seriously by regulators, perhaps due to the close alignment of logger-based monitoring technologies with those used in regulatory monitoring programmes." (p. 391)

But relationships do matter, when producing **robust knowledge**:
> "However, it should be noted that these projects emerged out of already existing relationships between environmental organizations and state agencies." (p. 391)

**Relations over time** play a role in adoption trajectories: 
> “(...)we cannot say whether adopting data loggers would facilitate closer ties between environmental organizations and regulators in other cases. Indeed, not all environmental organizations that are now using data loggers have such close ties with regulators.” (Jalbert and Kinchy, 2016, p. 13)

# Key Finding: The Politics of Technology

CS provides more than "just data":
> “Beyond the production of data, projects that emphasize high levels of participation can produce engaged citizens who come together through water monitoring and mobilize politically.” (p. 393)

Success in monitoring programs requires to deal with the question: 
> “(...) how can these devices [data loggers] be implemented to collect data, but also give nonprofessionals broad scientific and political voice to articulate collective grievances?” (p. 393)

Critical insight:
> "...**automated sensing technologies do more than their intended technical tasks of recording the conductivity and temperature of threatened waters**. They also affect practices and relationships, altering the means by which concerned citizens can participate in public debates." (p. 394)

Remember:

## 1. Knowledge Infrastructures: *How Do We Know?*  🔍 📖
Knowledge Infrastructures are networks that make it possible to "think globally" through:
- Complex **systems** of people, institutions, and technologies
- **Layered** and **interconnected** operations: supporting 
- Creation and maintenance of **factual** **knowledge**
- KIs are **Consensus Holders**: common understandings of how we know what we know. 
- KIs have specific functions in the Anthropocene: **monitor, model, and provide a long-term memory of environmental change**
> "Build up a knowledge infrastructure, maintain it well, and you get stable, reliable, widely shared understanding." (Edwards 2010:20)

> "For us, infrastructures reside in a naturalized background, as ordinary and unremarkable as trees, daylight, and dirt. Our civilizations fundamentally depend on them, yet we notice them mainly when they fail." (Edwards 2010:9)

## 1.b. *What do we know?*  🪴 💾
#### **Environmental Data:**
Information or measurements that describe and account for: information or measurements that describe and account for environmental processes, their locations, or conditions; their social implications and/or origins; ecological or health effects and consequences; or the performance of environmentally relevant technology.

## 2. A *Sociotechnical* view.  🛠 🏘

- When we say *sociotechnical*, we focus on:
	- Specific connections between technology and society
	- Logics partly technical and partly social: co-constructed
	- Path dependence in technical and social developments
	- KIs endure over time because they are stable, reliable, and based on shared understandings 
 
> Social interactions, flexible interpretations, and historical circumstances fundamentally shape technologies. The success or failure of specific technologies goes beyond the intrinsic technical properties. Technical artifacts and social entities co-construct each other, along with their meaning, their sense of purpose, and their deployment trajectories. (Bijker 1995)

> "Just as global environmental visions have shaped the development of infrastructures of environmental surveillance, so have those infrastructures, in turn, shaped scientists' global visions." (Benson 2012)

## 3. Features of Infrastructure 🔻🔺

- Embeddedness in systems
- Transparency in operation
- Reach/scope beyond local
- Learned through membership
- Linked to conventions
- Built on installed base
- Visible upon breakdown

### Infrastructural Inversion:
> "To understand an infrastructure, you have to invert it. You turn it upside down and look at the 'bottom' — the parts you don't normally think about precisely because they have become standard, routine, transparent, invisible." (Edwards 2010:21)

## 4. Standards 🗒📓
- Have effects on *People and Machines*:
	- How does *consensus* looks like? How can a vision be translated into technical tools that work for many? (Argos)
	- What is a priority? What do we measure? (Globalizing "we"; remote sensing as a "universal")
	- What is considered useful? What is waste? (Repurpose data)
	- How can we use data for different goals from the original intent? (remote sensing for monitoring)
	- What do we preserve? How do we make it present? (Memory practices)
	- Protocols: measures, processing, sharing, communication, integration, etc. 
- Implications: network externalities, *de facto* standards, negotiation and power dynamics, **integration, reutilization, repurposing, openness, sharing**. 

> "There is no simple break point at which one can say that communications protocols stop and technical standards start." (Bowker 2008:113)

## 5. Memory Practices 🤔 ⏳
- Memory practices: remembering and making things present 
- Accessing the past is mediated by others.
- Our "drive to database" supports digital technologies. 
- Data management is a challenge: a **distributed collective practice**

> "Databases are not a product of the computer revolution; if anything the computer revolution is a product of the drive to database" (Bowker 2008:109)

> "Memory prostheses have multiplied around us; memory devices are legion; memory practices have been organized on massive scales: we now hold in the global memory details of events hundreds of thousands of years ago" (Bowker 2008:110)

## 6. New Ways of "Sensing" 📡
- Digital tech affects how we relate with the world
- Can be programmed: distribute and organize instructions and operations 
	- In people and machines (Edwards 2010)
	- In (memory) practices (Bowker 2008)
	- In visions and imaginations (Benson 2022)
- The earth is *programmable* and *(re)programmable*
	- KIs devoted to environmental data can support participation (CS)
	- Open Resources support re-utilization (Open Data in Remote Sensing)

> "Sensing is then not just a process of generating information but also a way of informing experience. (...) Programmability, as I employ the term, has a somewhat wider use than just software or code... it is an embodied and embedded set of operations that are articulated across devices, environments, practices, and imaginations." (Gabrys 2016:11-12)

## 7. User Communities & Infrastructure 🫂
- Infrastructure enabling collaboration and co-construction
- Visions shape infrastructure, infrastructures shape vision (Socio-technical; co-construction)
- Multiple perspectives can coincide in the same technology (Wildlife biologists and Meteorologists in Argos; Remote Sensing monitoring)

> "Just as global environmental visions have shaped the development of infrastructures of environmental surveillance, so have those infrastructures, in turn, shaped scientists' global visions." (Benson 2012:860-861)

> "The difference between meteorologists' and wildlife biologists' methods and goals corresponded with the relative value they placed on reliability, precision and standardization, on one hand, and flexibility and miniaturization, on the other." (Benson 2012:854)

## 8. Participation & Citizen Science 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 🥼
- Environmental justice meets epistemic justice
- Alternate ways of assembling and infrastructuring knowledge
- Opportunity for community participation, advocacy, and priority setting. 
- People advocating for themselves and impacting policy and regulations. 
- Dilemmas: volunteer participation/technology deployment, data credibility, contextualizing data, scalability issues. 

> "Citizen scientists are not only observers and stewards of their local environments; they constitute a political force for policy change at multiple levels of governance." (Kimura & Kinchy 2019:74)

> "...automated sensing technologies do more than their intended technical tasks of recording the conductivity and temperature of threatened waters. They also affect practices and relationships, altering the means by which concerned citizens can participate in public debates." (Jalbert & Kinchy 2016:394)

## 9. Data Standpoints 🔭 🔬
- **Authorized** Seeing and universals:
	- View from nowhere (Science)
	- View from everywhere (Expert advice)
	- View from somewhere (Witnessing)
- Key Implications: power relations, knowledge legitimacy, data representation (Globalizing "we;" CS and epistemic injustice; limitations in monitoring)

> "Despite the neutral aesthetic of satellite imagery derived from its photogenic quality, its production, and analysis are deeply political." (Bennett et al. 2022:731)

> "If critical remote sensing achieves anything, it should be to humble and de-universalize the technology, exposing its inescapably earthly origins and its entanglement with particular social, political, and technical conditions and power relations" (Bennett et al. 2022:745)

## Classification Systems as Infrastructure Builders

Bowker, Geoffrey C., and Susan Leigh Star. 1999. “Some Tricks of the Trade in Analyzing Classification.” In _Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences_, 33–50. The MIT Press. [https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001).

This chapter presents a close-up of infrastructure and infrastructured practices, especially those that label, categorize, and organize the world to be knowable. As with any other infrastructure, classifications are part of larger systems and work in a standardized manner. Classifications are constructed social arrangements that have material consequences. These systems, the authors show, are not just about organizing information; they have an active role in shaping what can be known, who can know it, and how it can be acted upon. Sometimes by design, other by the emergent nature of the systems, these systems have real-world implications to the limits of what can be monitored and advocated for.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 1200px; width: 1800px; min-height: 1200px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

## Infrastructure & Classification Fundamentals

Classification systems are *peculiar cultural, technical, and scientific artifacts*:
> "Systems of <mark>classification (and of standardization) form a juncture of social organization, moral order, and layers of technical integration</mark>. Each subsystem inherits, increasingly as it scales up, the inertia of the installed base of systems that have come before." (Bowker and Star, 1999, p. 34)

We revisit the properties of Infrastructure to present a socio-technical understanding. 

Examples of *infrastructural inversion* introduce a double sociotechnical vision: 
- Large-scale, bureaucratic classifications and standards have material grounds: 
	- Cow example: a constitutive nature of supply houses of biological materials that are critical for research. 
	- Thermometer: a new tool, the *silent sister* as an indicator of entangled medical politics, technical designs, and metrics for patients. 
- There are interactions between conceptual framework + disciplinary politics + use of metrics for classifying (this is critical for sustainability work)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## 1. Ubiquity 

> "Classification schemes and standards literally saturate our environment. In the built world we inhabit, thousands and thousands of standards are used everywhere" (p. 38)

Key characteristics:
- Interdependence
- Integration
- Embedded in systems 

> "Although it is possible to pull out a single classification scheme or standard for reference purposes, in reality none of them stand alone. So a subproperty of ubiquity is interdependence, and frequently, integration" (p. 39)

## 2. Materiality and Texture 🧵🪡

> "The second methodological departure point is that classifications and standards are material, as well as symbolic." (p. 40)

Physical and conventional arrangements:
> "All classification and standardization schemes are a mixture of physical entities, such as paper forms, plugs, or software instructions encoded in silicon, and conventional arrangements such as speed and rhythm, dimension, and how specifications are implemented." (p. 40)

> <aside class="notes"><p>The materiality extends to how we program and implement environmental monitoring systems.</p>

## 3. Indeterminacy of the Past 

> "There is no way of ever getting access to the past except through classification systems of one sort or another - formal or informal, hierarchical or not." (p. 42)

Multiple perspectives:
> "No one classification organizes reality for everyone" (p. 42)

Critical insight:
> "Thus, the indeterminacy of the past implies recovering multivocality; it also means understanding how standard narratives that appear universal have been constructed" (p. 42)

## 4. Practical Politics

> "Whatever appears as universal or indeed standard, is the result of negotiations, organizational processes, and conflict." (p. 45)

Key aspects:
- Power dynamics in classification
- Visibility and invisibility
- Negotiated standards

> "For all the reasons given above, large-scale classification systems are often invisible, erased by their naturalization into the routines of life. Conflict and multiplicity are often buried beneath layers of obscure representation." (p. 48)

## Infrastructure and Method: Convergence

> "Systems of medical observation and treatment are set up such that physical manifestations are the only manifestations recorded. Physical treatments are the only treatments available. Under these conditions, then, logically schizophrenia may only result purely and simply from a chemical imbalance in the brain. It will be impossible to think or act otherwise. We have called this the principle of convergence" (p. 50)

The convergence principle:
- Systems shape what can be known
- Methods determine what can be observed
- Classifications become self-fulfilling

> <aside class="notes"><p>&quot;This blindness occurs by changing the world such that the system&#39;s description of reality becomes true.&quot; (p. 50)</p>

## Implications and Resistance
- Example of **Nuclear Weapons**
	- Technologies get forgotten or abandoned (political and social choices).
	- Technologies need to be maintained: social and institutional support.
	- They are not just physical objects; they depend on networks of knowledge, institutions, and practices to be possible.
	- You can "un-invent" through neglect. 
- How to challenge classifications and standards? Problematizing these artifacts is a way of resistance. 
- **Tyrannies of Inertia**: feedback and verification may seem inescapable; but they are never entirely locked in. 
- How do you think this is important for environmental monitoring? do you see a relation with our discussion around CS?

> <aside class="notes"><p>This highlights the importance of understanding both the technical and social aspects of classification systems, particularly in environmental monitoring and citizen science contexts.</p>

## Metadata or "Data about Data" 💽🔖
### A Framework for Understanding Information

- Some systems automatically generate metadata and provide context to unprocessed or *raw* data.
- There is nothing objective about metadata - it always makes a statement about the world (what it includes, what it omits, where it draws its boundaries and the terms it uses to describe it)
- It is selective in what it includes and omits (needs to be to be useful)
- It serves as a critical tool for organizing and finding information 

> Example: In a phone call, metadata includes the number called, time, and duration - but not the conversation itself

## Types of Metadata 🖇
### Four Essential Categories

95. **Descriptive Metadata**
   - Also known as "finding metadata"
   - Helps locate and identify resources
   - Most familiar and conspicuous type

96. **Technical Metadata**
   - System requirements and specifications
   - Necessary for proper rendering and delivery
   - Usually invisible to users unless problems occur

97. **Rights Metadata**
   - Manages intellectual property information
   - Includes ownership details and copyright laws
   - Controls access permissions

98. **Structural Metadata**
   - Builds links between data pieces
   - Assembles complex objects from simple components
   - Defines relationships and hierarchies

## From Data to Knowledge ⏩
### The Information Pyramid

- Metadata serves as the "glue" connecting each level.
- Enables the transformation of raw data into meaningful information
- Facilitates pattern recognition, leading to knowledge
- Supports analysis and interpretation for understanding

## Curation and Preservation 🗃
### Metadata's Role in Memory
**Key Functions:** standardize data to be preserved and recovered (made present). Support the evolution of interlinked pieces of wisdom (culture). 

99. **Identification**: select defining elements. 
100. **Connection**: links between elements, build context and relationships. 
101. **Curation**: detect relevant elements and decide which are important.
102. **Preservation**: maintaining historical continuity, capturing transformations.
103. **Access**: enabling discovery and understanding, facilitating cultural transmission.

## Metadata and the aggregation of power in Data Description
Acker, Amelia. 2021. “Metadata.” _Uncertain Archives: Critical Keywords for Big Data_, February, 321–29. [https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/12236.003.0035](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/12236.003.0035).

The chapter argues that metadata goes well beyond technical documentation, and that it can be thought of as a powerful instrument of representation and control since it shapes what portions of data are understood and accessed. This produces effects on how power structures can be challenged, reflected, and even reinforced. Metadata is, at the end, creating or limiting possibilities for representing the world we live in and the dynamics it holds.
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#e6eed6" template="" -->

## What is at Stake?

- Metadata reveals the values and ideologies of those who use them
- Shapes data-driven experiences of the world
- Acts as gateways influencing identity and authority
- Critical for long-term preservation, access, and control
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#dde2c6" template="" -->

## Power of Classification 📑

- Metadata driven by the urge to classify and categorize
- Creates systems to represent phenomena across time/space
- Hidden origins of metadata structures reflect power.
- Standards and taxonomies can reenact and reinscribe biases
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-light-background drop" data-background-color="#bbc5aa" template="" -->

## The Gap Problem 🕳

Key challenge in big data culture:
- Distance between data creators and collection contexts
- Data/metadata accumulated without creator's/user awareness
- Impact on representation stakes
- Creators often can't access their own metadata

## Real World Implications 🌇
Examples of metadata power:

- Social media platform classifications
- Housing discrimination through advertising categories
- Library subject headings debates
- Environmental sensor networks
- Surveillance systems

## Critical Questions 🤔
For metadata systems we should ask:

104. Who controls the naming and categorization?
105. What experiences are left out through omission or ideology?
106. How do metadata structures reinforce existing biases?
107. Who has access to metadata about themselves?
108. How does metadata shape our cultural memory?

## What is a Data Model? 💾

- It is a conceptual mapping of the relations of all the data within a system, a **structured representation** that maps relationships between:
	- Data elements within a system
	- Data and system processes
	- Logical connections across datasets
- **Key Functions**
	- **Organization**: Structures how data is stored, defines relationships between data points, creates standardized formats
	- **Operations**: enables specific queries, facilitates data analysis, and supports merging data sources. 
	- **Management**: guides database design, ensures data consistency, enables system scalability
- Critical for: 
	- Data integrity and analysis reliability. 
	- Usability: challenges around retrieval, reusability, and query requirements.

## Standardizing for collaboration 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Wohner, Christoph, Johannes Peterseil, and Hermann Klug. 2022. “Designing and Implementing a Data Model for Describing Environmental Monitoring and Research Sites.” _Ecological Informatics_ 70 (September):101708. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101708](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101708).

This is a technical paper presenting a way to enhance data quality and usability for environmental research. It shows how to deal with quality and usefulness data fundamentally in the environmental research space. Emphasizes how the structure, documentation, and sharing of information about research sites matters. Data modeling, it shows, is a crucial process that shapes how environmental knowledge is created, shared, and used.

## Starting point 🕐

- Data models are iteratively worked upon (versioning)
- Problems:    
    - What do the fields mean (e.g. site owner)?
    - Unclear documentation requirements.
    - Redundant fields (e.g. research topics- parameters, history-purpose, overlapped descriptions)
    - Geographic data issues (e.g. size differences, sampling areas, etc.)

## Classification Systems & Infrastructure 🏷 🗄

Understanding how classifications shape knowledge and 
action.

- Classifications are social arrangements with material properties and consequences
> "Systems of <mark>classification (and of standardization) form a juncture of social organization, moral order, and layers of technical integration</mark>. Each subsystem inherits, increasingly as it scales up, the inertia of the installed base of systems that have come before." (Bowker and Star, 1999, p. 34)
- They shape what can be known and how it can be acted upon.
- Properties: Ubiquity, Materiality and Texture (physical-software mix), Indeterminacy (of the past), Practical politics (universals are negotiated)
- Critical for understanding environmental monitoring systems (defy the *tyrannies of inertia* and un-invent through neglect).

## Computer models: at the heart of climate politics

Edwards, Paul N. 2010. “Simulation Models and Atmospheric Politics, 1960–1992.” In _A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming_, 357–96. MIT Press. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhds1](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhds1).

In this chapter, Edwards presents simulation models as a key component to producing policy-relevant knowledge in climate sciences. He explains how they became the policy tools we know today and how their logic and existence are entangled with the climate crisis. He also discusses how key components of crisis, constituency, and theory co-evolved to establish a stable set of model predictions, principles, and data trends.

## Policymaking and the importance of the future ⏩ 🕐
- Policy institutions notice issues when: 
	1. There is a **crisis**
	2. There is a **constituency** that cares about that crisis
	3. There is a **theory** of why the crisis is occurring and how to solve it. 
	- CO2-induced global warming started with none of these elements; they evolved from 1960 to 1992. 
- **Models** are simulation tools reduce the complexity of systems (otherwise hard to be studied directly)
- In climate science, models work as a critical knowledge infrastructure: **they bridge science and policy action** ("the most highly developed tool to predict future climate" Policymaker summary / IPCC 1990)

## How Climate Change became Policy Issue: The Role of Models 📈
From scientific modeling to public crisis

- The interaction between climate modelers and policy bodies boosted the legitimacy of modeling.
- Models supported the notion of crisis: 
	- Public policy agencies
	- General public
- From 1960 to 1990s, models became legitimate sources to guide policy

## Early Climate Modeling: Origins in Weather Modification 🌬 
Climate scientists manage to connect, to "frame", their work to appeal to military interests. 

- Controlling local weather: military, aviation, and agriculture (short-term, deliberate)
- Vietnam War provided "crisis, constituency, and plan" for weather control.
- Models needed to verify if these technologies worked
- Scientists linked this to broader climate concerns
- Pres. Sci. Adv. Comm. - PSAC expanded scope to **CO2** **monitoring** and **geoengineering**

> "Seeking relevance (and funding), climate scientists sought to connect climate change with the weather-modification agenda by framing it as '**inadvertent weather modification**.'" (p. 361)

## A "ground for renewal" in Atmospheric Politics: facing the data gap 🕳

- **Context**: First Earth Day (1970), Silent Spring (1968), Apolo 8 (1968), end of the post-war era (chemicals)
- Environmental concerns were "commonplace" but lacked specific data
- No "confirming data" to transform the notion (pollution -> climate) into an actionable crisis.
- There was information scattered across sciences and institutions

> "Critically needed data were fragmentary, contradictory, and in some cases completely unavailable. This was true for all types of data — scientific, technical, economic, industrial, and social." (Edwards, 2010, p. 366)

- GCM: the only way to explore relations involved in climate (SCEP - SMIC)
- Global climate monitoring network
	- Push for uniform data collection standards
	- Need for international measurement standards

## The Limits to Growth: Legitimizing Global Simulations 📈💥
Limits to Growth (1972) the 1st model of global problems: 
- **Simulation enters the stage:** first model to reach mass audiences and policy elites (at the same time)
- Complex **systems** can be "counterintuitive" (fixes can make things worse)
- Data collection problems: no central authority, different standards, temporal and spatial gaps --> requires **modeling to fill gaps**. 

Impact:
- Established simulations as **policy-relevant tools** (e.g., press and environmental movement)
- Computer simulation's potential to connect **environmental, social, and technical concerns**
- Demonstrated need for global systems thinking

## Building Climate Politics in the 1970s 🔗

- **Constituency**: the energy crisis created policy opening (Carter Adm, DoE, EPA)
- NCPAs: national focus over global concerns 
- Agencies have sectoral models: models couldn't work together (limits to networked science)
- First policy-oriented assessment (Charney report, NRC)
- Geneva 1979: more attention to climate, further research, better data (theory)
- W Clim. Res. Program (WCRP - 1980): calls for a **machinery to produce authoritative statements for a policy** (later, the IPCC)

## Stabilizing Climate Projections
### The Power of "Sticky Numbers" 🔢

The key was to find ways to move from scientific complexity to policy action. This created the basis for future assessments. 

> "Climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide doubling is a key figure for climate modeling because it provides a simple, direct way to compare the very complex models" (p. 380)

- Means for managing uncertainty: **climate sensitivity range** 1.5-4.5°C (remained stable for 28 years)
- Simplified complex models for public communication.
- Focus on CO2: extend and stabilize the knowledge of the past + establish projections doubling scenarios.
- Numbers became "sticky" in policy discussions: persist and maintain influence over time.

## Global Warming Enters Mass Politics (1980s) 🗳 🌡

> "...[In the 1980s, Global Warming] emerged from the shadows of science-based policy advice to become a full-blown issue in mass politics." (p. 381)

- Central Issues of global atmospheric politics leaned on models: 
	- Nuclear winter hypothesis: model-based investigations (effects of nuclear war)
	- Also model-based: CFCs and Ozone-depletion (volcanic eruptions - SST controversy)
- Epistemic communities go *beyond consensual knowledge*:
	- Shared beliefs about cause-effect relationships
	- Common practices for testing and confirmation
	- Shared values and interpretive frameworks
	- Power through authoritative knowledge claims
	- Integration of scientists, organizations, policymakers, and NGOs
 
> "Consensual knowledge does not tell the full story... The broad scientific consensus marked by the Ozone Trends Panel report occurred after the Montreal Protocol had already been signed." (Edwards, 2010, p. 388)

- 1979: Charney report's first firm predictions
- 1988: Hansen's testimony to Congress
- 1988: IPCC creation
- 1992: Rio Framework Convention

Evolution:
- Models became central to knowledge claims. 
- A loose research strategy turned into a global action program.
- Climate politics went from "sporadic handwaving" to sustained policy (to...?)
	- (1) crisis; (2) constituency; (3) theory

## Smart Cities and Climate Models 🔎 🖼

What are models about? What is their role, and how do they sustain climate politics? Why are their numbers so “sticky” for governing climate?

- Key elements for policy intervention (a defined crisis, a constituency that cares, a theory of causes and solutions).
	- SCs: **crisis** (resource management, sustainability), **constituency** (city planners, tech companies, city dwellers), theory (sensors can optimize processes). 
- Climate Models 🟰 Smart Cities
	- Make processes visible and actionable through data.
	- Build a framework to perceive complex processes (urban metabolism)
	- Generate new possibilities for action. 
- Climate Models 🚫 Smart Cities
	- The **focus** is not set on prediction but on **grasping continuous, real-time transformations**
	- Digital Infrastructures in SCs create an **experimental space**.
	- **Distributed agency** (human and technical entities)
- Becoming is a continuous and indeterminate process.

## Smart cities: form speculation to materialization 🌆 👩‍💻🚶‍♂

Gabrys, Jennifer. 2016. “Digital Infrastructures of Withness. Constructing a Speculative City.” In _Program Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet_, 241–65. Electronic Mediations 49. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. [https://muse.jhu.edu/book/45371](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/45371).

Gabrys focuses on *Smart Cities* to present a case about the limits of *technosolutionism* (i.e., the overreliance on technical fixes to complex problems) and the need to extend *programming* (i.e., operations that are articulated across devices, environments, practices, and imaginations) beyond automation. She focuses on expanding our understanding of infrastructures and the relations they enable. Smart City technologies are not predeterminate tools for optimization and efficiency; they fundamentally (re)shape urban experience in a contingent, indeterminate process. The materialization of digital technologies produces new modes of inhabiting the city. In this sense, digital infrastructures rise as experimental, open-ended systems continuously generating unexpected connections and possibilities, challenging linear narratives of technological progress and urban development.

## What is in a Smart City? 🗺 🤖
- Sensor networks (motion, flows, etc)
- CCTV systems, perimeter Security systems
- Threat detection software. 
- Retrofitting Infrastructure, adding a digital layer on: 
  - Electricity grids (Smart meters)
  - Sewer and water distribution (leaks and cracks, flow rates)
  - Waste management systems
  - Urban transportation networks (live arrivals time display, journey planning tools, automated/driverless trains, bike rentals, etc.)

## Sensor ubiquity  🌇 🎡

- Smartphones as sensor hubs: humidity sensors, temperature sensors, GPS, accelerometers
- Embedded in urban infrastructure: electricity grids, water mains, waste management systems, 
- Transit networks: pedestrian crossing traffic management, bus arrival time tracking, GPS location monitoring, collision prevention systems. 
- Continuous monitoring: underground system temperatures, vibration detection, humidity levels, equipment degradation

## How does this make a City "Smart"? 🧠

- Real-time data collection
- Predictive capabilities
- Adaptive infrastructure
- Interconnected sensor networks
- Automated decision-making processes

> “What are the processes that these infrastructures instigate and sustain? How do they at once individuate and join up cities and citizens? What are the capacities of these infra-structures and what modes of inhabitation do they facilitate?” (p. 242)

- Digital infrastructures actively create **new environments**, new relations, and ways of being in the city. 
- They are more than just a tool (utility)
- The are a constitutive element in shaping urban life and experience

## Speculative practices in urban contexts 🔮 🧑‍💻

- What does Gabrys mean by *speculation*? 
  - *Speculative* can be contrasted with *material*
  - Near-future representations made present in current installations 
  - It is about generating new modes of collective existence
- Speculation relates to programming in the sense that it organizes elements (sensors + codes + people) towards desired trajectories. 
- Technological implementation limits speculative practices. 
> "Speculation is not a project of making fictions but rather is a practice of <mark>constructing particular trajectories of urban practice and inhabitation.</mark>" (p. 244)

## Withness as "becoming together" 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🤖
-  *Smart* is part of a rhetoric that focuses on measuring

- Witness is about engagements between humans and more-than-human, co-occurrences with and through digital infrastructures.
> "Digital infrastructures draw our attention to the ways in which the <mark>occasions of cities would not be possible without infrastructural processes</mark>. Distinct urban processes are facilitated, enabled, and connected up through these digital infrastructures.” (p. 244)

## The Desigo System and Self-Regulation 💻 🎚

- Located in [*The Cristal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hall,_London_(Newham))*, a flagship of *sustainable infrastructure*
- Manages the building operations through a "system of systems"
- Functions without human intervention
- Incorporates environmental monitoring (external and internal
- Responds to nature (harvest rainwater, solar panels, geothermal, etc.)

## Remaking the City in Electronic Form 🔌

- Game for running a city
- A "well-designed city" is one merged with technological development. 
- Quantification is a condition for computation: _can't measure, can't manage it_ 
>  “Digital infrastructures are part of this accumulation of automaticity, where new structures, organizations, and processes of digital connectivity come together to articulate particular modes of withness for subjects (human and nonhuman) and to advance particular ways of “possessing”— and making— worlds.” (Gabrys, 2016, p. 14)

## Modes of withness

- How do infrastructures become a real thing? How do they materialize and become *concrete*?
- Through processes of: 
	- measurement, 
	- automation, 
	- contingency

## Measurement and Enumerating as Infrastructural Logic 🧮

- **Parsing**: Transforming Complexity into Measurable Data
	- Breaking down the collective process into quantifiable units
	- Converting urban experiences into measurable variables

- Complex environments are pushed into data streams.
- Creates "enumerated" representations of urban life.
- Enables new forms of management and prediction. 
- **Examples**: traffic density, temperature variations, air quality levels, energy consumption patterns

> “[measurement becomes even more infrastructural than in other infrastructures], it is a condition and resource that enables social processes and organization (...) by the overlapping, intersecting, and (ideally) interoperable streams of data that allow correlations to be made across previously separate infrastructural milieus.” (p. 255)

## Infrastructure as Automation 🎛 ⚙️

We need to rethink technological action and relation:
- Enumeration and Automation: transforming data into automatic processes. 
- Developers automate (scripts and codes) to sync up circulations. 
- Automatism actually limits the ways we engage with technology. 
- Simondon: "Technology is far more inventive when open and indeterminate"
- Here, machines are open systems with human interpretation. 
- What is the sacrifice of automation? 
	- Restricts functional possibilities and reduces potential uses of technological systems. 
	- Humans are flattened into a relationality (not exceptional, a parcel to move along, a node of information, one more sensor)
- Measurement and automation are connectivity modes: machines talk (and must talk) to other machines.
- *Computation is not always a closed loop*: new orders of indeterminacy (openness, possibilities) arise as computation becomes environmental.

## Infrastructure as Contingency  ➰❓
- As things move from abstraction to concretization, they are more indeterminate (Simondon)
- Contingency refers to the capacities of entities that might not even be known before their connecting and relating.
- Implementation is making things concrete: infrastructure enables withness. 
- Withess means less scripted and more generative (new indeterminacies)
- Infrastructures can be thought of:
	- as **assemblages** (the result of addition, design, intention) or 
	- as **intersections** (contingent, indeterminate), made possible by parsing and connecting.

## Smart Cities: From Utilities to Living Systems 🌲🏘

- Technology is not just a "utensil" (optimization, predetermined outcomes, efficiency)
- Participatory projects tend to move toward the same end goal of "managing and regulating cities in order to achieve efficiencies and solutions" (p. 261)
- The human is often "flattened" into just another data point - "one more node of information, one more sensor-actuator operation taking place in the city"
- Through "Withness" Gabrys proposes reconsidering participatory urbanism
	- Thinking participation as "processes of becoming together" across human and more-than-human entities
	- Moving beyond agency-based models of participation (to stressing mutual influence)
	- Account for mutual influence and ways of becoming together.
	- Focusing on how different entities influence each other through "persuasion and infection" rather than direct action

## Call to Experimentation 🖥 🎵

- Allow for unpredictable outcomes. 
- Consider how we "think with, being with, and becoming with the smart city"
- Create more "inventive environmental inhabitations"
- Technology is more than tools mediating pre-existing entities: it is *world-making and world-sustaining*. 
- Technology <mark>new forms of relationship and ways of existing</mark> in the city. 
- Tech takes part in complex processes that create new ways of living in and experiencing cities.
- More experimental and open-ended approaches are needed (not just focusing on efficiency and control). 

> "Digital infrastructure is a multiple and more-than-human event, which may be further described as a process whereby multiple actual entities become tuned in to shared registers of withness, along with shared practices for making worlds.” (Gabrys, 2016, p. 263)

## Strategic and creative data configurations

Fortun, Kim, Lindsay Poirier, Alli Morgan, Brandon Costelloe-Kuehn, and Mike Fortun. 2016. "Pushback: Critical Data Designers and Pollution Politics." _Big Data & Society_ 3 (2): 2053951716668903. [https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951716668903](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951716668903).

This paper presents Critical Data Design as a process and Critical Data Designers as actors who draw on interpretative skills and processes to turn scientific data and findings into claims and visualizations that achieve meaning in a given political context. CDDs need to be able to grasp and fully understand what counts as a social problem in a specific context. This requires *hermeneutic* expertise (account for what things mean, to whom, why, and to what end) along with scientific skills, using each body of knowledge as leverage while building publics and public problems.

## Critical Data Design (What) 📐✏

- Finding, linking, visualizing and circulating available data is an <mark>interpretative skill</mark> (hermeneutic skill)    
- Linking scientific expertise ↔ data ↔ hermeneutics (understand what things "mean")
- Elements / Challenges of CDD:
       - C1. Critical Data practices "network" things to meaningful and actionable ways.
    - C2. Data Advocacy (focused on collection, availability and usability) supports the possibility of CDD
    - C3. Quantity (too abundant or too scarce)
    - C4. Time (lags between monitoring and availability)
    - C5. Connecting Environmental Data (pollution) to Local Contexts [e.g. health data to pollution data]

## Hermeneutics as Pushback 🙌 

> "…on interpretive skill in finding, linking, visualising, and circulating available data; they **pushback** against **entrenched ways of thinking about public problems** through politically strategic and creative data configurations." (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 1)

## Hermeneutics as leverage 
- Knowledge toxicology, ecology, air chemistry, and other scientific fields
- Read and interpret the social, political, historical, and cultural context in which they work
- Design comes as a response to how people "think and talk" about problems, possibilities, and responsibilities.

> "They thus **linked scientific and technical expertise with hermeneutic expertise**, taking into account what things mean, to whom, why, and to what end – becoming what we call critical data designers" (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 3)

## Publics and problem set up
- Publics need to be _provoked into existence_ through collective recognition (J. Dewey)
- Recognition comes from acknowledging negative externalities of our current affairs (state, market, social action)
- Data is crucial as it provides signs and symbols to grasp and assess Natural (and social) forces.
- CDDs work as _translators_ using data to address 'eclipsed' problems (against public interest).
- CDDs goal is to create a "new systems of signs that can provoke new publics into existence".

> "The work of **conversion of the physical and organic phase of associated behavior into a community of action** saturated and regulated by **mutual interest in shared meanings**, (…) does not occur all at once nor completely. At any given time, **it sets a problem rather than marks a settled achievement.** (Dewey 1984 [1927]: 330–331)" (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 3)

## Parsing as Critical Design 🔗 📐

- Coupling analysis and technological possibilities to cultural landscapes (changes in both ways)
- Data Design: like a radar (for rainstorms)
    - Estimation of ozone around sensors (space re-arrengement): modelling with finer granularity
    - Temporal re-arrengement (near real-time)
- Leverage experience and perspective to the linearity of scientific research.
- Bring back decision into automation.

> "(…) Price is able to parse many problems associated with conventional approaches to environmental health research and governance. In response, he's built and envisioned alternative approaches, becoming what we've called a critical data designer." (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 9)

## Pushback: design + experimenting 🙌 🧪

- Technical capacities, alone, are not sufficient (available data, processing, etc.) 
- Critical Data Design is to <mark>link data and problems so to _translate_ nascent awareness into _public problems_</mark> by:
    - Locating data (archiving, documenting, and describing it)
    - Interpreting relevance (culturally): know what is compelling
    - Create and circulate compelling visualization (experiment)
- Hermeneutics tribute to:
    - Subjectivity, creativity, and inspiration
    - Cultivated, validated, evaluated
- CDD is both "a technical and interpretative process," it is:
     - about reading and interpreting as much
     - as experimenting with ways of _making things public_ and _making publics_   

> "Interpretive or hermeneutic capacity is capacity to understand what things mean, to differently situated actors, why, and with what effect on what will follow." (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 11)

## Dynamics of CDD, a rubric 📝 ✅

Critical data designers produce **politically strategic and creative data configurations** 
Accomplishing this depends on multiple **capabilities**, both *technical* and *hermeneutic*, and involves:
- Identifying *problems* warranting public concern;
- *Understanding data* as a crucial albeit always limited and biased societal resource;
- Recognizing multiple, diverse *factors shaping data availability and use*;
- Recognizing how standardization, categorization, and other ways of *configuring data both produce and delimit insight*;
- Pinpointing and addressing diverse *ethical issues* at many stages of data engagement;
- Generating *multiple perspectives* on all foci of concern, enabling figure-ground reversals, perspective at different scales, and what can be called kaleidoscopic logic;
- Identifying and accessing relevant/appropriate proxy data;
- Creating *layerings* and *recouplings* of data that loosen entrenched conceptual habits
- Remaining *aware of the margins* created by all data visualizations;
- *Sustaining and governing collaborations* necessary for critical data design;
- Continually reading to *strategically engage the (discursive) context* in which data claims are made and legitimated

## Critical Gaps for Environmental Justice 🕳

### Missing Social Context:
1. Community Impact Documentation
   - Local population effects
   - Historical environmental burdens
   - Socio-economic implications

2. Power Dynamics
   - Data ownership structures
   - Access to information
   - Decision-making influence

3. Justice Considerations
   - How is community knowledge integrated?
   - Who else can benefit from data collection? 
   - What voices are missing?

## Usability at the center
Dosemagen, Shannon, and Emelia Williams. 2022. “Data Usability: The Forgotten Segment of Environmental Data Workflows.” _Frontiers in Climate_ 4:1–9.

This piece presents a take on the problem of how to access, understand, and (re)utilize data beyond its original intent. This serves for both, government agencies but also communities that are involved in data generation activities. The problem of networking data and different users, which is referred to as the usability of data(sets), is critical for decision-making that is data-centered like in environmental monitoring. Enhancing participation is something that data infrastructures can incorporate as a design component. This article pushes forward the idea of having environmental data as a public good, something especially relevant in the context of  participatory environmental governance.

## Challenges in Environmental 🍃🌴 + Community Science 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🔬

1. Data landscape with asymmetries.
2. Focus: research on the questions of communities + co-equal partnerships between communities and scientists
3. . Already available open government datasets
4. Engagement and representation in environmental governance

## Why Now? The Opportunity Moment
1. **Policy Context** 
	  - Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act (2016)
	  - EPA's renewed environmental justice focus
	  - Whole-of-government approach adoption

2. **Technical Evolution**
	  - Next-generation sensors (data usable by agencies, e.g., PurpleAir, airbeam, noise sensors, etc.)
	  - Increased data accessibility (whole-of-government)
	  - New monitoring tools

For those thinking about policy memos: <mark>context is crucial</mark>

# Data as an Environmental Justice Tool

1. Community Data Value
  - Socially situates environmental issues
  - Documents lived experiences
  - Provides multiple perspectives
  - Enables political agency

2. Institutional Integration
  - Beyond outreach and engagement
  - Co-equal partnerships needed
  - Moving past "data contributor" role
  - Forecasting intervention needs

## Streamlined data workflow 
The language that we use, *pipeline*, suggest a clear rout from collection to enforcement.

## Actual data workflow
- Workflows underperform (when ensuring usable and useful data for communities)
- Deeper engagement and representation is difficult
- The burden of working with data systems is placed on communities
- Govt. should grant access and use to agency-gathered environmental data.

## **Why?** Data as a Tool for Environmental Justice 🧰

1. **Community Data'**s Role:
	  - Socially situates environmental issues
	  - Documents lived experiences
	  - Provides multiple perspectives on the pollution burden
	  - Helps forecast needed interventions

> "Community data is not a replacement for government inaction, or an avenue leading to community-industry partnerships, but should be seen as a way for communities to build agency in political decision-making." (p.5)

## Interaction with Knowledge Infrastructures 🥼 🏛️

Current Issues:
> "Communities seeking to be part of the environmental data infrastructure have been categorically dismissed or viewed as data contributors (rather than co-equal partners)" (p.5)

Needed Changes:
1. Move beyond the outreach/engagement model
2. Develop co-equal partnerships
3. Create bidirectional data flows
4. Enable meaningful community input
5. Build agency 
6. Socially situating environmental issues
7. Documenting lived experiences: capturing "multiple truths" of how people experience pollution

## **How to get there?** 
### Building Collective Accountability 🤝

A multi-faceted approach through which we collaboratively:
1. Build models for incorporating diverse datasets
2. Standardize across data systems
3. Build legitimacy through accountability

Requirements (system)
- Hybrid social-legal-technical approaches
- Respect for community boundaries
- Input beyond public comment

## Environmental Data as Public Good 

1. Public Good Characteristics:
  > "Through a dual approach that ensures environmental data is a public good—it is non-rival and non-excludable—we mechanize its ability to be an accountability measure in both directions" (p.6)

21. Implementation features:
  - Universal accessibility
  - Collaborative ownership
  - Reusability emphasis
  - Administrative justice

## Towards Systemic Change 🔄

1. Design Principles: technology should not leave people out (create with not for)
2. Infrastructure Requirements: data usable and useful
3. Collective responsibility: a *workable public good*
4. Goals:
	  - Unburdensome governance
	  - Clear input mechanisms
	  - Collaborative environmental governance

## Classification Systems & Infrastructure 🏷 🗄

Understanding how classifications shape knowledge and 
action.

- Classifications are social arrangements with material properties and consequences
> "Systems of <mark>classification (and of standardization) form a juncture of social organization, moral order, and layers of technical integration</mark>. Each subsystem inherits, increasingly as it scales up, the inertia of the installed base of systems that have come before." (Bowker and Star, 1999, p. 34)
- They shape what can be known and how it can be acted upon.
- Properties: Ubiquity, Materiality and Texture (physical-software mix), Indeterminacy (of the past), Practical politics (universals are negotiated)
- Critical for understanding environmental monitoring systems (defy the *tyrannies of inertia* and un-invent through neglect).

## Computer models: at the heart of climate politics

Edwards, Paul N. 2010. “Simulation Models and Atmospheric Politics, 1960–1992.” In _A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming_, 357–96. MIT Press. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhds1](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhds1).

In this chapter, Edwards presents simulation models as a key component to producing policy-relevant knowledge in climate sciences. He explains how they became the policy tools we know today and how their logic and existence are entangled with the climate crisis. He also discusses how key components of crisis, constituency, and theory co-evolved to establish a stable set of model predictions, principles, and data trends.

## Policymaking and the importance of the future ⏩ 🕐
- Policy institutions notice issues when: 
	1. There is a **crisis**
	2. There is a **constituency** that cares about that crisis
	3. There is a **theory** of why the crisis is occurring and how to solve it. 
	- CO2-induced global warming started with none of these elements; they evolved from 1960 to 1992. 
- **Models** are simulation tools reduce the complexity of systems (otherwise hard to be studied directly)
- In climate science, models work as a critical knowledge infrastructure: **they bridge science and policy action** ("the most highly developed tool to predict future climate" Policymaker summary / IPCC 1990)

## How Climate Change became Policy Issue: The Role of Models 📈
From scientific modeling to public crisis

- The interaction between climate modelers and policy bodies boosted the legitimacy of modeling.
- Models supported the notion of crisis: 
	- Public policy agencies
	- General public
- From 1960 to 1990s, models became legitimate sources to guide policy

## Early Climate Modeling: Origins in Weather Modification 🌬 
Climate scientists manage to connect, to "frame", their work to appeal to military interests. 

- Controlling local weather: military, aviation, and agriculture (short-term, deliberate)
- Vietnam War provided "crisis, constituency, and plan" for weather control.
- Models needed to verify if these technologies worked

## A "ground for renewal" in Atmospheric Politics: facing the data gap 🕳

- **Context**: First Earth Day (1970), Silent Spring (1968), Apolo 8 (1968), end of the post-war era (chemicals)
- Environmental concerns were "commonplace" but lacked specific data
- No "confirming data" to transform the notion (pollution -> climate) into an actionable crisis.
- There was information scattered across sciences and institutions

> "Critically needed data were fragmentary, contradictory, and in some cases completely unavailable. This was true for all types of data — scientific, technical, economic, industrial, and social." (Edwards, 2010, p. 366)

## Building Global Environmental Data 🌍
1970-72: push for worldwide monitoring
- SST (supersonic transport) controversy:
	1. Climate Impact Assessment Program (institution + 100 scientists)
	2. Attention to anthropogenic aerosols (power plants, factories, automobiles, etc.)
- GCM: the only way to explore relations involved in climate (SCEP - SMIC)
- Global climate monitoring network
	- Push for uniform data collection standards
	- Need for international measurement standards
	- Integration of existing monitoring programs

## The Limits to Growth: Legitimizing Global Simulations 📈💥
Limits to Growth (1972) the 1st model of global problems: 
- **Simulation enters the stage:** first model to reach mass audiences and policy elites (at the same time)
- Complex **systems** can be "counterintuitive" (fixes can make things worse)
- Data collection problems: no central authority, different standards, temporal and spatial gaps --> requires **modeling to fill gaps**. 

Impact:
- Established simulations as **policy-relevant tools** (e.g., press and environmental movement)
- Computer simulation's potential to connect **environmental, social, and technical concerns**
- Demonstrated need for global systems thinking

- NCPAs: national focus over global concerns 
- Agencies have sectoral models: models couldn't work together (limits to networked science)
- First policy-oriented assessment (Charney report, NRC)
- Geneva 1979: more attention to climate, further research, better data (theory)
- W Clim. Res. Program (WCRP - 1980): calls for a **machinery to produce authoritative statements for a policy** (later, the IPCC)

## Stabilizing Climate Projections
### The Power of "Sticky Numbers" 🔢

The key was to find ways to move from scientific complexity to policy action. This created the basis for future assessments. 

> "Climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide doubling is a key figure for climate modeling because it provides a simple, direct way to compare the very complex models" (p. 380)

- Means for managing uncertainty: **climate sensitivity range** 1.5-4.5°C (remained stable for 28 years)
- Simplified complex models for public communication.
- Focus on CO2: extend and stabilize the knowledge of the past + establish projections doubling scenarios.
- Numbers became "sticky" in policy discussions: persist and maintain influence over time.

> "...[In the 1980s, Global Warming] emerged from the shadows of science-based policy advice to become a full-blown issue in mass politics." (p. 381)

- Central Issues of global atmospheric politics leaned on models: 
	- Nuclear winter hypothesis: model-based investigations (effects of nuclear war)
	- Also model-based: CFCs and Ozone-depletion (volcanic eruptions - SST controversy)
- Epistemic communities go *beyond consensual knowledge*:
	- Shared beliefs about cause-effect relationships
	- Common practices for testing and confirmation
	- Shared values and interpretive frameworks
	- Power through authoritative knowledge claims
	- Integration of scientists, organizations, policymakers, and NGOs

- 1979: Charney report's first firm predictions
- 1988: Hansen's testimony to Congress
- 1988: IPCC creation
- 1992: Rio Framework Convention

Evolution:
- Models became central to knowledge claims. 
- A loose research strategy turned into a global action program.
- Climate politics went from "sporadic handwaving" to sustained policy (to...?)

## Smart Cities and Climate Models 🔎 🖼

What are models about? What is their role, and how do they sustain climate politics? Why are their numbers so “sticky” for governing climate?

- Key elements for policy intervention (a defined crisis, a constituency that cares, a theory of causes and solutions).
	- SCs: **crisis** (resource management, sustainability), **constituency** (city planners, tech companies, city dwellers), theory (sensors can optimize processes). 
- Climate Models 🟰 Smart Cities
	- Make processes visible and actionable through data.
	- Build a framework to perceive complex processes (urban metabolism)
	- Generate new possibilities for action. 
- Climate Models 🚫 Smart Cities
	- The **focus** is not set on prediction but on **grasping continuous, real-time transformations**
	- Digital Infrastructures in SCs create an **experimental space**.
	- **Distributed agency** (human and technical entities)
- Becoming is a continuous and indeterminate process. 
- Technologies are more than utensils (experiment and invention).

## Smart cities: form speculation to materialization 🌆 👩‍💻🚶‍♂

Gabrys, Jennifer. 2016. “Digital Infrastructures of Withness. Constructing a Speculative City.” In _Program Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet_, 241–65. Electronic Mediations 49. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. [https://muse.jhu.edu/book/45371](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/45371).

Gabrys focuses on *Smart Cities* to present a case about the limits of *technosolutionism* (i.e., the overreliance on technical fixes to complex problems) and the need to extend *programming* (i.e., operations that are articulated across devices, environments, practices, and imaginations) beyond automation. She focuses on expanding our understanding of infrastructures and the relations they enable. Smart City technologies are not predeterminate tools for optimization and efficiency; they fundamentally (re)shape urban experience in a contingent, indeterminate process. The materialization of digital technologies produces new modes of inhabiting the city. In this sense, digital infrastructures rise as experimental, open-ended systems continuously generating unexpected connections and possibilities, challenging linear narratives of technological progress and urban development.

## Speculative practices in urban contexts 🔮 🧑‍💻

- What does Gabrys mean by *speculation*? 
  - *Speculative* can be contrasted with *material*
  - Near-future representations made present in current installations 
  - It is about generating new modes of collective existence
- Speculation relates to programming in the sense that it organizes elements (sensors + codes + people) towards desired trajectories. 
- Technological implementation limits speculative practices. 
> "Speculation is not a project of making fictions but rather is a practice of <mark>constructing particular trajectories of urban practice and inhabitation.</mark>" (p. 244)

## Measurement and Enumerating as Infrastructural Logic 🧮

- **Parsing**: Transforming Complexity into Measurable Data
	- Breaking down the collective process into quantifiable units
	- Converting urban experiences into measurable variables

- Complex environments are pushed into data streams.
- Creates "enumerated" representations of urban life.
- Enables new forms of management and prediction. 
- **Examples**: traffic density, temperature variations, air quality levels, energy consumption patterns

> “[measurement becomes even more infrastructural than in other infrastructures], it is a condition and resource that enables social processes and organization (...) by the overlapping, intersecting, and (ideally) interoperable streams of data that allow correlations to be made across previously separate infrastructural milieus.” (p. 255)

## Infrastructure as Automation 🎛 ⚙️

We need to rethink technological action and relation:
- Enumeration and Automation: transforming data into automatic processes. 
- Developers automate (scripts and codes) to sync up circulations. 
- Automatism actually limits the ways we engage with technology. 
- Simondon: "Technology is far more inventive when open and indeterminate"
- Here, machines are open systems with human interpretation. 
- What is the sacrifice of automation? 
	- Restricts functional possibilities and reduces potential uses of technological systems. 
	- Humans are flattened into a relationality (not exceptional, a parcel to move along, a node of information, one more sensor)
- Measurement and automation are connectivity modes: machines talk (and must talk) to other machines.
- *Computation is not always a closed loop*: new orders of indeterminacy (openness, possibilities) arise as computation becomes environmental.

## Infrastructure as Contingency  ➰❓
- As things move from abstraction to concretization, they are more indeterminate (Simondon)
- Contingency refers to the capacities of entities that might not even be known before their connecting and relating.
- Implementation is making things concrete: infrastructure enables withness. 
- Withess means less scripted and more generative (new indeterminacies)
- Infrastructures can be thought of:
	- as **assemblages** (the result of addition, design, intention) or 
	- as **intersections** (contingent, indeterminate), made possible by parsing and connecting.

## Smart Cities: From Utilities to Living Systems 🌲🏘

- Technology is not just a "utensil" (optimization, predetermined outcomes, efficiency)
- Participatory projects tend to move toward the same end goal of "managing and regulating cities in order to achieve efficiencies and solutions" (p. 261)
- The human is often "flattened" into just another data point - "one more node of information, one more sensor-actuator operation taking place in the city"
- Through "Withness" Gabrys proposes reconsidering participatory urbanism
	- Thinking participation as "processes of becoming together" across human and more-than-human entities
	- Moving beyond agency-based models of participation (to stressing mutual influence)
	- Account for mutual influence and ways of becoming together.
	- Focusing on how different entities influence each other through "persuasion and infection" rather than direct action

## Call to Experimentation 🖥 🎵

- Allow for unpredictable outcomes. 
- Consider how we "think with, being with, and becoming with the smart city"
- Create more "inventive environmental inhabitations"
- Technology is more than tools mediating pre-existing entities: it is *world-making and world-sustaining*. 
- Technology <mark>new forms of relationship and ways of existing</mark> in the city. 
- Tech takes part in complex processes that create new ways of living in and experiencing cities.
- More experimental and open-ended approaches are needed (not just focusing on efficiency and control).

## Strategic and creative data configurations

Fortun, Kim, Lindsay Poirier, Alli Morgan, Brandon Costelloe-Kuehn, and Mike Fortun. 2016. "Pushback: Critical Data Designers and Pollution Politics." _Big Data & Society_ 3 (2): 2053951716668903. [https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951716668903](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951716668903).

This paper presents Critical Data Design as a process and Critical Data Designers as actors who draw on interpretative skills and processes to turn scientific data and findings into claims and visualizations that achieve meaning in a given political context. CDDs need to be able to grasp and fully understand what counts as a social problem in a specific context. This requires *hermeneutic* expertise (account for what things mean, to whom, why, and to what end) along with scientific skills, using each body of knowledge as leverage while building publics and public problems.

## Critical Data Design (What) 📐✏

- Finding, linking, visualizing and circulating available data is an <mark>interpretative skill</mark> (hermeneutic skill)    
- Linking scientific expertise ↔ data ↔ hermeneutics (understand what things "mean")
- Elements / Challenges of CDD:
       - C1. Critical Data practices "network" things to meaningful and actionable ways.
    - C2. Data Advocacy (focused on collection, availability and usability) supports the possibility of CDD
    - C3. Quantity (too abundant or too scarce)
    - C4. Time (lags between monitoring and availability)
    - C5. Connecting Environmental Data (pollution) to Local Contexts [e.g. health data to pollution data]

## Hermeneutics as Pushback 🙌 

> "…on interpretive skill in finding, linking, visualising, and circulating available data; they **pushback** against **entrenched ways of thinking about public problems** through politically strategic and creative data configurations." (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 1)

## Hermeneutics as leverage 
- Knowledge toxicology, ecology, air chemistry, and other scientific fields
- Read and interpret the social, political, historical, and cultural context in which they work
- Design comes as a response to how people "think and talk" about problems, possibilities, and responsibilities.

> "They thus **linked scientific and technical expertise with hermeneutic expertise**, taking into account what things mean, to whom, why, and to what end – becoming what we call critical data designers" (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 3)

## Publics and problem set up
- Publics need to be _provoked into existence_ through collective recognition (J. Dewey)
- Recognition comes from acknowledging negative externalities of our current affairs (state, market, social action)
- Data is crucial as it provides signs and symbols to grasp and assess Natural (and social) forces.
- CDDs work as _translators_ using data to address 'eclipsed' problems (against public interest).
- CDDs goal is to create a "new systems of signs that can provoke new publics into existence".

> "The work of **conversion of the physical and organic phase of associated behavior into a community of action** saturated and regulated by **mutual interest in shared meanings**, (…) does not occur all at once nor completely. At any given time, **it sets a problem rather than marks a settled achievement.** (Dewey 1984 [1927]: 330–331)" (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 3)

## Environmental disasters (as inspiration for CDDs)

- How data has been used in governing industrial disasters. _Ethnographies of late industrialism._   
    - Bhopal 🇮🇳 (Union Carbide - 1984) Data gaps and discursive risks (complex, long-term health effects of chemical exposure): medical records, causal links missing, patterns of suffering.
    - Fukushima 🇯🇵 (Tepco - 2011): gaps in radiation monitoring, conflict of official and independent monitoring, discursive risk (downplaying)
- How KIs are transforming HOW we know things (collaboration, data collection/theory formation, new questions, institutions and assumptions about what is valid, new forms of expertise)

## Scorecard 📇 🔢

- Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) made public machine-readable.
    
- Emissions and 'Phantom reductions' (de-listing chemicals; lobbying)
    
- TRI data: toxic activism
    
- Scorecard's vision: link existing data to enable interpretation and directed action.
    
- Scorecard is an example of: data size issues, connections to scientific findings, the act of think locally but with a global scope.
    

> "Scorecard takes on some of the most recalcitrant prob-lems within environmental politics - the need to deal with too little, as well as too much, information; the need to deal with contested scientific findings andintractable uncertainty about long-term effects; the need to think locally, as well as comparatively and globally" (Fortun, 2004, p.60-61)

## Parsing as Critical Design 🔗 📐

- Coupling analysis and technological possibilities to cultural landscapes (changes in both ways)
- Data Design: like a radar (for rainstorms)
    - Estimation of ozone around sensors (space re-arrengement): modelling with finer granularity
    - Temporal re-arrengement (near real-time)
- Leverage experience and perspective to the linearity of scientific research.
- Bring back decision into automation.

## Pushback: design + experimenting 🙌 🧪

- Technical capacities, alone, are not sufficient (available data, processing, etc.) 
- Critical Data Design is to <mark>link data and problems so to _translate_ nascent awareness into _public problems_</mark> by:
    - Locating data (archiving, documenting, and describing it)
    - Interpreting relevance (culturally): know what is compelling
    - Create and circulate compelling visualization (experiment)
- Hermeneutics tribute to:
    - Subjectivity, creativity, and inspiration
    - Cultivated, validated, evaluated
- CDD is both "a technical and interpretative process," it is:
     - about reading and interpreting as much
     - as experimenting with ways of _making things public_ and _making publics_   

> "Interpretive or hermeneutic capacity is capacity to understand what things mean, to differently situated actors, why, and with what effect on what will follow." (Fortun et al., 2016, p. 11)

## Dynamics of CDD, a rubric 📝 ✅

Critical data designers produce **politically strategic and creative data configurations** 
Accomplishing this depends on multiple **capabilities**, both *technical* and *hermeneutic*, and involves:
- Identifying *problems* warranting public concern;
- *Understanding data* as a crucial albeit always limited and biased societal resource;
- Recognizing multiple, diverse *factors shaping data availability and use*;
- Recognizing how standardization, categorization, and other ways of *configuring data both produce and delimit insight*;
- Pinpointing and addressing diverse *ethical issues* at many stages of data engagement;
- Generating *multiple perspectives* on all foci of concern, enabling figure-ground reversals, perspective at different scales, and what can be called kaleidoscopic logic;
- Identifying and accessing relevant/appropriate proxy data;
- Creating *layerings* and *recouplings* of data that loosen entrenched conceptual habits
- Remaining *aware of the margins* created by all data visualizations;
- *Sustaining and governing collaborations* necessary for critical data design;
- Continually reading to *strategically engage the (discursive) context* in which data claims are made and legitimated

## Data practices and technologies for managing change  

Gabrys, Jennifer. 2020. "Smart Forests and Data Practices: From the Internet of Trees to Planetary Governance." *Big Data & Society* 7 (1): 205395172090487. [https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720904871](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720904871).

Gabrys takes a look at how forests are being transformed into digital entities, in turn embedded in emerging governance mechanisms that can exist at different scales, most notoriously on a planetary scale. Through five key digital practices—observation, automation/optimization, datafication, participation, and regulation/transformation—she presents how forests are increasingly conceptualized as technical problems rather than complex ecosystems or places for other cosmogonies and cultural narratives. She zooms into the ways to determine what counts as relevant data as forests become entities "meant to operate as technologies" rather than ecosystems with other possible values. She emphasizes the implications this has for future environmental engagement, governance structures, and the relationship between humans and forests.

## Component of *Smart Forests* 🌲🌳

- Forests + Digital Tech + Data Analytics
    
- Technologies involved:
    
    - Air/Space:  UAVs/drones, LIDAR scanning, remote sensing
        
    - Data/Analysis: ML, AI, storage
        
    - Monitoring: Sensor networks, civic apps/platforms
        
- Goal: map environmental change, guide reforestation, monitor land-use change
    
> "Digital infrastructure is a multiple and more-than-human event, which may be further described as a process whereby multiple actual entities become tuned in to shared registers of withness, along with shared practices for making worlds.” (Gabrys, 2016, p. 263)

## Three steps in networking tress to planetary governance 🌎

1. **Effect** of digitalization in:
    
    - Understanding of the environment
        
    - Practices + ontologies (1) to address environmental change
        
2. Five data-based digital **practices** to govern change (observation, automation/optimization, dataification, participation, transformation/regulation)
    
3. Forest **operate** as *technologies* (as a result of dig.): technical instruments informed by data.
    

(1) Ontology: nature of reality or existence brought into being by **practices, technologies, and infrastructures** (Jensen 2015)

## Translation of *Smart Cities* to *Smart Forests* 🏙️ 🌲

1. Forests are a digital/technical problem of measurement, data collection, automation
    
2. Categories enacted (often by expert or elite actors) reinforce inequalities
    
3. From *smart cities* to *smart forests:* **presented as unproblematic to meet environmental goals** (planetary scope)
    
4. Changes in governance and participation: from local actors to remote/corporate --> **extended politics** (by parsing and connecting)

## Knowing environmental change to govern change 🤔 

1. What are the effects of these intersections (environment, data, dig. tech., social life)?

## Observation: managing a *resource* 🏦 👀

1. Observational techs + practices (remote sensing, ubiquitous computing, or supply-chain monitoring).
    
2. Make them *visible* (as stores for timber/carbon sinks)
    
3. Making *invisible* as sites for others things (indigenous cosmologies, cultural narratives, other ways of being in the world)
    
4. Mobilization and legitimization of actors and processes.
    
    1. Audit and integrity through accounting (blockchain)
        
    2. Excluded actors from these sites of relevance and action.

2. Who organizes and runs the networks?
    
3. How is data gathered, stored, and operationalized?
    
4. Automatic practices can collide with existing practices (communities, CS projects, scientists) and create *power imbalances*
    
5. Real-time information requires information about: what to automate and optimize? (not de-politized)
    
6. Technologies co-construct a governance regime (local, national or planetary scale): who manages?

## Datafication 💽💾

1. Data: piece and tool of governance.
    
2. Transforming things to data to act on them.
    
3. New land management practices.
    
4. Politics of expertise: things do not always fit with (modes of research, governance, or socio-political interaction)
    
    - exclusion practices: carbon credits, forest management protocols (timber vs. ES), selective logging, etc.
        
    - pol. of expertise: conflicts of on-the-ground reports with satellite data, metrics vs. qualitative observation

## Participation 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑

- Platforms to enhance participation (Global Forest Watch, I-tree, hotlines; participatory mapping)
    
- They shape civic engagement with forest and env. change
    
- Engagement from a distance (e.g., Amazon fires from 2019)
    
    > Participatory techs are ways of making the forest "present, senseable, and actionable in certain ways, for distinct actors, and through specific datasets [through parsing and connecting]."

## Regulation and transformation 📏

- Precision Forestry: expedite reforestation (UAVs, sensors, computer models, data analytics, AI) - *What type of civic and political engagements they create?*  
    
- Start-ups
    
- Forest transform (trough technical and policy interventions) into a technology:
    

> "Technologies that would govern these environments in order to address and mitigate environmental change are also transforming them into **entities that are meant to operate as technologies**. Smart forest technologies and systems thus contribute to the reworking of what a forest is and how it operates" ([Gabrys, 2020, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/VVGR67X9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZYLTKJR?page=7&annotation=LAYNH95N))

## Planetary governance and smart forests 🌍

- Expansion of the *smart* model: socio-political effects?

- Digital practices (of observation, automation, optimization, dataification, participation, regulation, and transformation) make possible the reconfiguration of **Forest** as a **socio-techincal** system of interactions.
    
- Digital techs have **consequences and possibilities** in how we respond to environmental change.

## Intro: Causes for Fires 🌲🧯

Over the past two decades, wildfires increased in frequency, magnitude and severity. Main causes:

1. Forest Management (inadequate): dense fuel-rich forests due to the [CO2 Fertilization Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2_fertilization_effect).
    
2. Climate change: woodlands and grasslands are hot, dry tinder boxes.
    
3. Urbanization and changes in land-use: smaller buffers, bigger interfaces, increased probability of man-made ignitions (wires, bottles, uncontrolled fires, cigarettes, etc.).

## _Taming_ fire 🔥: Modelling Risk based on Relations and Positions

The author presents the limitations of wildfire modelling and the impact it has on fire management. It reframes fire as a matter of connection and a networked phenomenon. He compares fire management to public health interventions to show how spreading can be similar in both cases. It presents then the limitations of an "individualistic" approach to fire risk scoring. Discusses the implications for the new model and the development of a socio-technical framework that integrates physical infrastructure, vegetation patterns, social dynamics, and institutional coordination. This is crucial to address equity concerns and engage in community-co-produced solutions. In this modelling, resilience comes, as a community, from understanding and addressing differences and diversity among the community.

## Why modelling wildfires (differently)? 💻🔍

- Inform policies (risk scoring based on building materials, properties)
    
- Optimize intervention/mitigation (spatial distribution of actions)
    
- Understand spreading patterns (experience with pandemics)
    
- Understand the place of buildings (in connection to other buildings + vegetation)
    
- Find inter-dependencies to calculate vulnerability (by building)
    
- Develop real-time adaptation by predicting tipping points (satellites, drones, sensors)
    
- Achieve socially acceptable and equitable solutions (co-production)

## Stakeholders connected to this modelling 👥🤝

1. Communities: be prepared, mitigate to influence risk, help gathering data.
    
2. Policymakers: address ineffective policies, enforce compliance of fire rules, create mandates and protocols (fire, data sharing), coordinate efforts (firefighters, centralized hub, agencies coordination)
    
3. Insurance companies: improve risk assessment, better calculate premiums, etc.
    
4. Engineers: technical infrastructure, result analysis and interpretation, integrate data sources into the data workflow.
    

Key component --> Consensus

## Modelling Intermediate Inter-connectivity 🌐🔗

1. Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires are different: systemic nature (property of the building <--> nearby vegetation <--> structures already burning)
    
2. Fire spreads through different mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation, ember spotting)
    
3. Early Models: focus on wildlands, constraints in computational processing (Comp. Fluid Dynamics), Simple Risk Assessment, Limited Data Sharing (fragmented data), social factors (built environments)
    
    1. Logic: Short-range interaction.
        
    2. Goal: Reduce potential of a building to catch fire (valid when homes are not close - Home Ignition Zone / HIZ)
        
    3. Gaps: communities with limited vegetation

## Alternate Approach 🔄💡

1. Rationale: capture the interaction between structures and vegetation, as a network.
    
2. Goals: coordinate scarce resources (optimization)
    
    1. Better assess damage
        
    2. Real-time assessment
        
    3. Help allocating resources (firefighters)
        
    4. Establish evacuation routes.
        
    5. Orient fuel-reduction efforts.
        
    6. Establish buffer zones.

1. New technologies (satellites, drones, sensor networks) provide multi-scale readings --> a more holistic approach
    
2. Community: refined scales (distribution)
    
3. Real-time data (APIs as infrastructure; parsing/connecting)
    
4. Identify Influential Neighbors (building + veg)
    
    1. Reduces the size of the graph.

## Using and Integrating the Model: some Challenges 🚧⚙️

1. Collection and integration of different data sources.
    
2. Cross-sector collaboration (govt, firefighters, agencies, insurance, academic, eng, etc.) --> Build consensus on how we know and how we act.
    
3. Community engagement: preparedness, mitigation, participation.
    
4. Interventions: optimal spatial distribution of resources, networked resilience, buffer zones, clear vegetation
    
5. Policy: change risk scoring, nuance policies (not all properties require the same mitigations), incentives for strategic mitigation.

## Fire Management and Cultural Burning 🔥👐

- There are other ways of *relating* to fire.
- Observation practices track and trace features of forests as "carbon sinks" (Gabrys 2020)
- There are pre-existing practices and community infrastructures for addressing fire (Chile example)
- Cultural Burning and Traditional Fire Management do _manage_ the forest but in different ways. What do you think that changes?
*Lets see an example!*

## Introduction to visualization 👓 👪 🖍  
- What is *Data Viz*? Turning data into graphic representations. 
- Historical and socio-technical context: 
	- Large datasets (Volume, *big data*)
	- Heterogeneous data (Variety in data sources, *parsing* and *connecting* different data streams)
	- Datafication and digitalization (Speed, Access to tools, Increased Circulation)
- Data Visualization (or Data *Viz*) is a **critical piece** of Knowledge Infrastructures, leaning on:
	- Visual Languages (through Art and Design)
	- Statistics and processing power (to support iterations)
	- Digital Affordances (user interaction, increased circulation, accessibility, reproducibility)
- Data Viz has new **sense-making** possibilities; it can support learning, engaging, and mobilizing for action.

## Early Viz examples: Map Making 🗺 

- Maps communicate critical information clearly and efficiently. 
- 19th Century: key role planning and commerce (e.g., the emergence of *trade routes*)
- They (re)present pre-existent classification schemes:
	1. Maps are embedded in existing classification systems and governance mechanisms. 
	2. They depend on and integrate a multiple set of standards. 
	3. They are an example of practical politics (results of negotiations, visibility-invisibility)
- Maps are a source of power (e.g., military campaigns, commercial routes, sea currents, river topography, etc.)

   Correctness, humor, and Australia day. 
2. The *School of South* and Joaquin Torres Garcia's [América Invertida](![](Pasted image 20250316203452.png)) (1943)
> "I have called this 'The School of the South' because in reality, our north is the south. There must not be north for us, except in opposition to our south. Therefore we now turn the map upside down, and then we have a true idea of our position, and not as the rest of the world wishes. The point of America, from now on, forever, insistently points to the South, our north."

## Data Viz as a Spectrum 🌈
- Data visualization exists on a spectrum of complexity and engagement.
  
- Each level builds upon previous elements while adding new dimensions.
  
- Movement from simple, direct representation to complex, narrative forms.
 
 ### **Charts < Infographics < Interactivity < Dashboards < Storytelling**
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## Dashboards: a way of "Being With Data"  🖥  ✅

- Dashboards are dynamic visual interfaces that present information at a glance, they *organize multiple data* points, metrics, and visualizations into the same screen. 
- They are a way of allowing us to "be with data" (Tkacz, 2022): user exploration, personalization, integration, monitoring. 
- This is another example of withness and "Becoming Together" (Gabrys 2016)
- Steady data production, quantity and proliferation of instances for *being with data*. Example:
> “...these ways of being with data. It is not simply that running has become ‘datafied’ – that is, turned into a bunch of data points and made amenable for metrification and analysis– though this is a necessary component. Rather, post-datafication, running itself is transformed – at least for those making use of the respective devices. <mark>Running now contains a data element; it has become running-with-data</mark> ” (Tkacz, 2022, p. 5)

## Data Visualization as Translation 🔁  🧏

- Data visualization translates abstract numbers into visual language
- This translation creates new connctionsÑ
    - New meanings and interpretations
    - Different relationships to the data
    - Novel forms of knowledge
- Translations have *trade-offs*: gains and losses (abstract-concrete, numeric-visual, expert-lay public, domain specific-general understanding)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## Audiences, Engagement, and Translation 👪 🪧

- Data visualization engages with publics and audiences **and can create new ones** (see *Critical Data Design*)
- Engagement strategies:
    - Aesthetic appeal and design (How they work? semiotics and aesthetics)
    - Interactivity and personalization (effects and uses)
    - Narrative structure and storytelling (sense-making)
    - Relevance to audience interests and needs (decision-making, action-oriented)
- Translation can happen in different layers (technical, cultural, rhetorical, etc). It depends on: context, audiences, purpose, elements, and argument supported. 
- Open data, open tools, reusability and democratic potential
-

## Data Viz for *Place-Making*

This paper presents the active role of digital technologies and data visualization in representing and reconstituting places. The transformation of the existing understanding of a place operates, shifting fixed and historical perceptions and conceptions of a place. This happens through processes of multiplying possibilities, releasing objects from fixed classifications, and raising awareness of potential (not yet present) dangers. New ways of being with data open possibilities, such as creating new publics and sparking novel conversations. Visualizations bring people together and set forth (i.e., they are *elicitation devices*) that bring people together around shared concerns. Visualization exercises, such as dashboards, should embrace "mud and mess" to incorporate lived experiences alongside metrics and mappings. The paper shows how visualizations mediate between climate and place, allowing communities to see themselves as places for climate action. They open possibilities for the future in a "socio-technical potentiality" to reimagine through data. Data is, then, a mediator between climate and place.

## Data and spatial effects 🌐

- Data Systems _reveal_ and _reconstitute_ environmental and social objects:
    
- New forms of data (of producing, modeling, using, and visualizing it) can:
    
    - Transform forms of expertise
        
    - re-make approaches to environmental action
        
    - re-figure agency and governance
        
    - re-work objects and subjects of environmental politics

## Key dynamics 🔄 🔀

Civic and institutional approaches to climate action can use data as a tool to _reveal places_:

- _Infowhelm:_ data can _enact places_ in multiple unfolding ways (overload of information).
    
- _Assembly:_ sense of place can be built in an iterative and open-ended way (possibilities and imaginaries not available before)
    
- _Dangers:_ proliferation, profiling, and the perils of portrayal (inequality, stigma, flattening complexity, limits to constructive engagement, misrepresentation, power imbalances)
    

Data reconfigure **new understandings and versions of place** that can relate to its _socio-technical potentiality_ (dynamic, malleable, and open to intervention)_._

## Data as mediator 💾 🚪

- Ethnographic work (auto-ethnography) on a project in _Newtown_: how to act on climate change locally?
    
- Engagement with data: new ways to help people plan and trasnform local energy infrastructure.
    
- Data as a _promising tool_ for mediating discussions (maps and data vizs)
    
- Data as a way of opening spaces for local action (climate change not as a global and stable issue): cutting through local politics (bring things to the same plane: flattening effect)
    
- Activities: repository, workshops (viz), community-led action plan, toolkit.

## Data proliferation: visualization, dashboards and translation 📈📊

From corporate-view to place-making:

- Google Environmental Insights Explorer (e.g., [South Bend](https://insights.sustainability.google/places/ChIJE9NhSsQyEYgRBDKjb7PZSpc?hl=en-US)): "Birds-eye view dashboard" showing a specific “potential” --> "Too narrow" and "too generic"
    
- Dashboard’s original intent: protect from mud splashes into the interior of horse hooves, hence “keep the mud and mess of social live at bay” (Mattern 2015)
    
- Dashboards: privilege actions framed by dashboard metrics.
    
- Repurposing the tool to “bring the mud back in”
    
- Opening possibilities: connecting places and account for places “poised for engaging” the challenges of climate change and energy transitions.
    
- Data-work: select, parse, analyze, and display data.
    
- Data-work and relevance: constitute neighborhoods as places of engagement and _socio-technical potentiality._

## Maps, Data, Profiling, and generativity 🗺

- Drifts: Dashboard --> community hub --> neighborhood profile
    
- Profiling through interaction with the map: what is significant in the community?
    
    - Map as a “mediating tool” to enable conversation
        
    - Map as an enabler of an “emergent orientation to objects and subjects”
        
    - Hockey stick (CO2 concentration): _surfaced_ stories of changes and industrial past in Newtown, prompted new conversations (talk about CC).
        
    - Transformed Newtown into a place ready to act on the challenges of CC
        
- Side-effects: profiling is also building objects to be governed (e.g., music recommendation systems).

## The Perils of Portrayal ⚠️

Visualization can make inequalities more concrete:

- Energy Performance Certificate mapping "invited interpretations which reinforced people's sense that they lived in an uneven economic geography"
    
- Data visualizations made "latent but viscerally felt politics" visible "in more concrete ways"
    
- Risk of reinforcing powerlessness: people felt "their capacity to shape their own lived environment was very limited"
    

Visualization can entrench rather than challenge existing perceptions:

- Workshop organizer concern: "we don't want people going away thinking 'we live in a shithole'"
    
- Index of Multiple Deprivation data seen as "potentially further stigmatising the area" by residents
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## The Perils of Portrayal ⚠️

Unrealistic Expectations:

- Wind turbine mapping created "misplaced hope that certain changes might be possible when actually they were not"
    
- Speculative data led community to imagine transformative infrastructure that wasn't feasible
    
- "What had been a speculative discussion about tentative possibilities had quickly run away with itself"
    

Variable Interpretations:

- Same data (deprivation indices) interpreted differently across communities:
    
    - As stigmatizing in one neighborhood
        
    - As "useful identification of need" in another
        
- Data visualization is never neutral; context and community history shape reception
    

Data effects "had to be carefully managed":

- "Careful work" means to channel insights toward "constructive interventions"
    
- Avoiding "a continued politics of frustration, refusal, resignation or withdrawal"

## Conclusions 📋

- Place-making through data as mediator:
    

> “the project came to reveal a substantially different understanding of place, with data serving to materialise place not as consolidated but instead as multi-layered, kaleidoscopic, sometimes overwhelming, and always open to change (…) by the end of the project we were collecting and sharing photographs,narratives, stories, assessments of wind possibilities, EPC ratings of buildings, thermographic images, archival documents and more.” (Knox, 2024, p. 10)

- When moving beyond conventional approaches data viz can be a generative catalyst:
    

> “Rather than seeing the local as a fragment or shard of a larger mythical whole, in Newtown <mark>the work of doing place through data created a sense of place as something that could be made through an ongoing process of confrontation and cross-pollination between different orders of knowing</mark>” (Knox, 2024, p. 10)

## Conclusions 📋

- Data is not a _transparent force,_ we need critical awareness and balance: 
> “…there are political possibilities in practices of profiling places through data, that extend and unsettle taken-for-granted understandings of place by refusing to treat its meaning as self-evident.” (Knox, 2024, p. 10)

- Place-making can be projected into the future using data and vizualizations:
> “…recognising that data can enact place anew as a socio-technical possibility, opens the door to <mark>other ways of approaching climate action</mark> to those which have characterised <mark>place as a local site of history and continuity</mark>, and <mark>climate as an abstracted and external driver</mark> of social and environmental change.” (Knox, 2024, p. 11)” (Knox, 2024, p. 10-11)

- Data and data viz have a critical role in place-making, making new publics, engaging with the public, experimentation, and shaping potential ways of addressing environmental and sustainability challenges.

## Withness 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🤖🧑‍🤝‍🧑

How humans and more-than-humans interact, coincide, and coordinate through digital infrastructures. 
- Emphasizes the contingent nature of technology deployment
- Creates new possibilities by connecting previously disconnected elements
- Enables new forms of environmental management and prediction
Modes: 
1. **Parsing** (connecting data sources, managing complexity, expanding possibilities)
2. **Automation** (structured instructions organizing technologies, institutions, and people; embedded assumptions; limit engagement) -- Technicity is not always a closed loop
3. **Contingency** (indeterminacy of technologies raises they move from abstract to concrete; unexpected)

[Module 3; smart forests and digital governance, Gabrys (2020)]

**Data Practices**: Behaviors and actions that produce specific results when working with digital technologies; modes of withness that shape human-environment relations
1. **Observation**: monitoring environments to protect integrity, defining what counts as part of the environment, making environments **visible** primarily as manageable resources, often **overlooks** cultural narratives or Indigenous cosmologies.
2.  **Automation/Optimization**: what to open/close in digital system designs, real-time information for decision-making, co-constructing governance regimes through data, who controls data gathering and organization?
3. **Datafication**: transforming environments into data points, creating data as "distinct objects and tools of governance", aligning data techniques with governance frameworks, potential conflicts with pre-existing (community) processes. 
4. **Participation**: making environments "present, senseable, and actionable", remote engagement with environmental issues, engagement through technological interfaces, new regimes of power and politics
5. **Regulation/Transformation**: opening new ways to regulate environments, transforming environments into "entities meant to operate as technologies", fundamentally reworking what environments are and how they function,

## Publics 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
[Module 3; critical data design, Fortun et al. (2016)]

Groups that care about specific issues and mobilize for action are"provoked into existence through collective recognition" of problems. Publics make problems visible and concrete. 
[Module 1; citizen science mobilization, Kimura & Kinchy (2019)]}

## Critical Data Design / Critical Data Designers 📝 📐
Finding, linking, and circulating data in connection to public problems, bridging technical data with social meaning to catalyze environmental action. Makes information meaningful, actionable, and usable.  Requires well-developed interpretative skill—new ways of thinking about data.

## Thinking about maintenance?

**Discussion**
1. Is maintenance hard? What do you think? 
    
2. Why is it important? Why does it matter for our class? 
    
3. What do we know about it?
    
4. How does it relate to environmental challenges? and environmental data?
    
5. Usability? 
    
6. Technology has phases: innovation, maintenance, and decay (Vinsel & Russell, 2020). What do you think affects that?

## True, Truce, and Target ✅ 🤝 🎯

Edwards, Paul N. 2019. “Knowledge Infrastructures under Siege: Climate Data as Memory, Truce, and Target.” In _Data Politics_, 21–43. Routledge. [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781315167305-2/knowledge-infrastructures-siege-paul-edwards](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781315167305-2/knowledge-infrastructures-siege-paul-edwards).

## Key concepts for today 

1. **Memory**: store, access, situate events in larger trends.
2. **Truce**: dealing with conflict and differences.  
    
3. **Target**: change and goals.

*Truces can become targets*: why would this matter for maintenance and data stewardship?

## Organizations and Routines 🏭 🏫

- What keeps organizational knowledge steady, reduces uncertainty, and enables coordination? Routines.
    
- Routines are at the center of automation; influence technologies.
    
- Some examples:
    
    1. Production (from inputs to products) and quality assessment
        
    2. Hiring (recruiting, interviewing, selection of personnel)
        
    3. Solving problems, R&D
        
    4. Investment decisions, budget allocation
        
    5. Pricing, marketing, distribution
        
    6. Planning, investing
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 1200px; width: 1800px; min-height: 1200px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

## Memory: data and data models 📂 🗄

- In KIs, maintenance addresses changes over time:
    
    - new observers, new organizations,
        
    - new methods, new standards, new tech
        
    - changes in political systems (national boundaries, priorities, etc.9
        
- _Consistency_ is a valuable currency for env. data
    
- No dataset is ever entirely definitive (revision, improvement, etc.).
    

> “Adjusting data was once a manual routine; today it is usually handled by computerized algorithms. I often call such algorithms “data models,” because they encode models of how different instruments or data sources relate to each other” (Edwards, 2019, p. 2)

Q: Why is consistency so important? Can you think of examples we discussed in class already where it matters?

## Truces: sustained cooperation 🤝

- Trust - Truth - Truce: shared origins in old Germanic (good faith).
    
    - Be true, faithful.
        
    - To trust someone (will do as promised).
        
    - Trews: pledges of faithfulness (Truce).
        
- Differences need to be “reconciled” to shared data to be meaningful
    
- Maintaining these agreements requires work.
    

> “The dramatic advance of the environmental and geosciences resulted in large part from routines-as-truces surrounding data. In meteorology, merchant ships from many nations began keeping standardized weather logs in the 1850s; these logs represented a truce among nations that used different temperature scales and other norms.” (Edwards, 2019, p. 3)

## Target: routines and technologies as patterns for new systems ⚙️🧑‍💻

- Transitions to new systems leans on existing routines (e.g., wastebasket, folders or phone icons) that serve as “targets” for new ones.
    
    - Early satellite data was adapted to balloon data (shimmering data)
        
    - Weather data has been shared since 1850s (brief interruptions)
        
- Routines as norms/patterns (for new routines/systems)
    
- Routines are goals (perform)
    
- Ways of enrolling new human and non-humans (shimmering data)
    
- Routines deal differences, conflict, calculations (data recording, data sharing, etc.)
    
- Organizations tend to replicate these patters in new routines/systems.
    

> “By now the overall point should be clear. Scientific memory requires truces: acceptance of common standards, suspending conflicts and disagreements to get on with routine data sharing, putting aside political and ideological differences to work together” (Edwards, 2019, p. 4)

## Targets as _Things to Shoot at_  🎯🥅

1. **Relevance** is made of connecting and balancing:  
    Problems/Crisis <-> Publics/Constituency <-> Explanation(s)/Solution(s)
    
2. In the 21st century: <mark>_truces became targets_.</mark>  
    Skepticism - _How do you think it affects balances around the climate issue?_
    
3. **Hypertransparency**. Data, algorithms, software, emails in the _public arena._

## Truces as Targets: Climate Audit and _the hockey stick controversy_

1. Target: temperature reconstruction (last 1000 years)
    
2. Epistemic communities: shared beliefs about causal relations, shared values and interpretative frameworks (e.g., Ozone depletion)

## Science Audits (McIntyre)

- **[Climate Audit blog](http://surfacestations.org/)** (2004): Steve McIntyre (mining, statistics) applied financial auditing concepts to climate science.
    
- **Claims:**
    - No _due diligence_ in peer review (examination of data and processing)
    - Peer review might suffer from "groupthink" or become "pal review";  data handling errors, improper statistical methods
        
- **Target**: Mann, Bradley & Hughes (1998, 1999) "hockey stick" temperature reconstruction showing unprecedented recent warming
    
- **_Climategate_** email leak: 1k emails, 3k documents before COP 15 (2009)
    
    - Claims of scientific misconduct (video [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvznTp7hor4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvznTp7hor4)))
- **Institutional response**: Multiple investigations by Congress, NSF, NAS, etc.
    
- **Outcome**: National Research Council (2006) noted some valid methodological concerns but confirmed the central finding that recent warming appeared unprecedented in 2000 years
    
- First major case of "truces as targets": **challenging scientific practices** (methods + review) through external public-facing audit attempts

## Surfacestations.org (Watts)

- **surfacestations.org** (2007)**:** Citizen Science Project
    
    - Connected to the blog WattsUpWithThat (WUWT)
        
- **Claim:** unreliable US temperature record _false warming trend_
    
    - Reported warming since 1970 is due to poorly sited weather stations
        
    - 650+ citizen volunteers surveyed USHCN stations
        
- **Target:** US Historical Climatology Network - USHCN (location of weather stations + data quality + data adjustment protocols)
    
- **Institutional response:** National Climatic Data Center - NCDC analized the data and showed that there was a _bias to cool_ temp in some stations.  
    
- **Outcome:** Watt’s co-authored a peer-reviewed paper the claim for bias was drastically tempered.

## Berkeley Earth (Muller) 🌎

- **BEST** (2010): a detail audit by an _agnostic_ on global warming, Richard Muller (Nuclear Physics - UC Berkeley)
    
- **Claim:** temperature records might be unreliable or biased, independent verification is needed, previous claims (McIntyre, Watts) required verification.
    
    - Collected data from weather stations (5x more data)
        
    - Developed quality control + homogenization methods
        
    - Open: data, algorithms, code
        
- **Target:** temperature records by climate institutions, data quality control and homogenization, consensus on global warming trends.
    
- **Institutional response:** Reports to US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
    
- **Outcome:** very similar trends
    
- **Funders:** US DOE, Bill Gates F., Charles Koch Foundation, Getty Foundation, and others.

## What do we learn Agnotology research?

1. Skepticism can be strategized (repeat disproven claims, attacking scientists).
    
2. Non-scientific motivations (ideology).
    
3. Media coverage (amplification of specific claim)
    
4. Delay action can be a goal.
    
5. Think tank infrastructure.
    
6. Credentials from unrelated fields.

## New Fronts in the Siege: From targeting outputs to eliminating inputs

### The 2017 Escalation

- Federal Administration: tactics shifted to more direct attack on infrastructure
    
- New approach: target knowledge infrastructures (satelites and data) rather than just outputs
    

### From Outputs to Inputs: A Strategic Shift

- **PAST STRATEGY**: Question conclusions, data analysis, uncertainty estimates
    
- **NEW STRATEGY**: Delete instruments and data collection capabilities

## Changes: targets and strategies (2017) 🎯

**New targets**

- Instruments required to track environmental change
    
- Climate change missions within government agencies
    
- Funding for environmental data collection and analysis
    
- Access to existing climate data
    

**Strategies:**

- Earlier "audits" challenged knowledge after production
    
- Current attacks prevent knowledge production at the source
    
- Represents more fundamental threat to climate knowledge infrastructure
    
- Can't challenge data that doesn't exist

## Challenges to environmental data infrastructure 

- Implications: if foundational data is not collected there is no debate, irreversible gaps in long-term environmental records, limitations in detection + response
    
- Post 2000 target on routines and truces (consensus)
    
- Audit culture: open _black boxes_ and appeals for transparency
    
- Outcomes: challenging platforms reinforced consensus.
    
- Some skeptics changed views (others did not)
    
- Audits are just one part of the issue:
    
    - Industry (fossil-fuel, mostly) supports these attacks.
        
    - Think tanks play a key role as institutional support for skeptics.
        
- Alter the balance with other explanations

## Infrastructure: cost a lot to replace 💰🏗

- Robust Networks (people, tech, and institutions) need
    
- Routine, reliable, widely accepted knowledge is not for ever.
    
- Balance needs to be also maintained

## Climate Skeptics and Audits 🔖

- What are they reclaiming?
- What limitations do they point to?
- How can these *truces* become a *target*? 
- Why are their efforts difficult to trust?
- What do we know about their decision-making process?

## What is Open Science? 👐 🥼

Open Science represents a movement to make scientific research, data, and outputs:

- **Accessible**: research outputs freely and widely available to potential users (findable, interoperable, cross-domain analysis)
- **Transparent**: accountability and scrutiny are needed to support credibility (sharing information about the entire process)
- **Collaborative**: across disciplines, territories, and stakeholders (respecting autonomy and diversity); working together makes science more robust
- **Reusable** by others for verification and extension (others can build upon previous work)

"The Open Science (OS) movement, with its emphasis on ensuring that research outputs, components and methods are widely disseminated, scrutinized and reused for the good of science and society, is but the latest chapter in the historical co-evolution of political and scientific accountability.” (Leonelli, 2023, p. 1)

## Key Components of Open Science

- **Open Access, Open Data, Open Methods**: Digital infrastructures to guarantee free and instant access to research papers, data and models
- **Open Notebooks**: Standardized note-taking tools, such as digital lab books, to help document and eventually replicate research procedures
- **Open Peer Review**: Reviewing systems that assess the robustness and validity of research outputs, thus fostering the publication of all high-quality results without necessarily making assumptions about what may be especially significant and for whom
- **Citizen / Community Science**: public engagement with science to bring insights from non-scientists into research 

*How do you think this relates to the concept of Knowledge Infrastructures?*

## What is needed for this to work? 

- **Institutional support and coordination**: OS public and private institutions around the world to set up strategies, from "national roadmaps to international treaties, online publishing platforms, updated checks on research quality and revised metrics for scholarly excellence." (Leonelli, 2023)
- **Technological infrastructure**: Robust digital infrastructure for sharing research outputs that ensure research is "findable and reusable."
- **Cultural shift in scientific practice**: Embrace transparency and sharing as core values, moving away from closed research and publication.

## What is needed for this to work?

- **Critical scrutiny and diversity**: OS depends on collective, critical, constructive scrutiny to ensure the reliability and robustness of research.
- **Balance between autonomy and coordination**: distribution of efforts without subsuming to one another. 
- **Balancing scientific freedom and societal needs**: 
- multiple, diversified in their approach and motivations, and at least partly independent from the vagaries of representative politics."

## Inclusion and Collaboration in Knowledge Infrastructures

This paper revisits the concept of Knowledge Infrastructures, but this time, the authors emphasize a two-fold invisibility that tends to go overlooked. One of the infrastructures that work in silent and unnoticed ways. And two, the invisibility of users and their own backgrounds and their diversity. By stressing the intersectional nature of identities, the paper stresses the importance of accounting for multiple forms of participation in Knowledge Infrastructures. This allows not only to improve the usability of platforms but also to enlarge their impact and extend their network into meaningful yet marginalized populations. Social Infrastructures, the article claims, are a central piece of KIs and should be addressed in their own terms, accounting for intersectional intra-group differences.

## Beyond generic views of Infrastructure 👓

- (Publicly funded) infrastructure does not serve all users equally [Cape Town]
- OS Action + Discourse: focus on infrastructures for sharing and reuse of data to enhance participation
- Shortsighted: technical groundwork will benefit all users (real and potential) of KI 
	- Innovation vs. Maintenance
	- Technical vs. Organizational work (techno-solutionism/techno-fix - *build it, and they will come*)
- How do we think about inclusive KI?
	- Intersectional approaches: concurrent existence of racism, sexism, and other forms of inequality
	- We will see how this is valid, also, for stewardship and maintenance.

## Defining and Designing KIs 📐 ✏

- KIs: groundwork for human achievement and empowerment (gaps, inclusion as connection)
- *Geek diplomacy*: sharing solutions that are important to them 
- *Open Hardware*: hacking, activism + networking, sharing, and repurposing (geographically diversity)
- But, what about *communication channels* between women in Cairo?
	- Gaining information about communities, the economy, status of their families.

Q: But, *Are these channels infrastructures?*

## Limits in the Design of KIs

- Assumptions have a risk: inaccessible/unusable KIs
- "Awesome" systems "mean nothing" if people are not looking for a different way of doing things: 
	- there is no way around inertia 
	- *interpretation* is crucial
- Problems may only be perceived by designers (and not by users)
- Over-representation of industry + business 
- New forms of exclusion + subordination

## Intersectionality and technologies

- Intersectionality and intra-group differences: the key to **debunking notions of objectivity and universality** (e.g., construction of differences in race/sex/gender/sexuality in medicine)
- Boundaries are inscribed in the act of *designing*
- Asymmetries of **power** and **contexts**

## Intersectional Approach 
- Three cases showing the *co-construction between social and material infrastructures*
- Openness: allows to negotiate what scientific processes are (inclusion-exclusion).
- The paper focuses on: similarities and differences (design + negotiation)
- Infrastructures are NOT end-to-end processes.
	- Ecologies of complex adaptative systems
	- Learning and adaptation are continuous 
- A more nuanced, broader definition of KIs: critical for sustainability and *robustness*

## Knowledge Broker for Disaster Management (Caribbean) 🌪🌴

- Original Idea: Mobile App, a platform for disaster response units
- Barrier: lack of consistent terminology. 
- Demand-side approach: virtual thesaurus (used by technical actors)
- Network building: more critical than the tech: disaster response officials, university-based mobile technology developers, university academics
- Align objectives and outcomes (management bodies)
- Translation into the language of partner organizations: apply openness to existing working areas. 
<mark>a cohesive, shared vocabulary was designed and agreed upon by all actors</mark>

## Virtual Herbarium  🌿 🇧‍🇷
- Knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity. 
- E-infrastructure to share biological collection data (system for data storage, retrieval, search and viz). 
- Institutions: not sharing unpublished data (credit), concerns about endangered species data. 
- Data Governance: avoid all-or-nothing deals: choose what to open. 
	- Negotiation of models of collaboration and vocabulary
	- Actors: biologists, programmers, students, researchers, herbariums
- Socio-political element 
> “...while knowledge infrastructures may appear largely technical, the **socio-political elements are most often key to making or breaking** its usage and negotiating its inclusivity” ([Okune et al., 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/S5LVA3BK))

## Research Contracts with Indigenous Communities 🗒 🇿‍🇦
- *Opening* Indigenous knowledge to the general public
	- Inter-generational knowledge (small, nomadic groups)
	- Tied to the stewardship of the land and the culture (survival in harsh conditions)
	- Indigenous communities in South Africa are diverse, with unique histories, languages, and shared knowledge.
- Early distrust (what does it tell us about *truces*? historical ground?): opposition to harnessing community knowledge 
- *Open* a space for the community to negotiate more equal terms. 
	- Co-design of a research contract: the community could set terms (not just the american university)
- Indigenous communities define when, where and how their community knowledge is used by 
external researchers  
	Actors: Indigenous community leaders; law practitioners/ researchers, feminist researchers 

> “...“openness” and the concept of “inclusivity” must be assessed critically: who is benefitting from open knowledge and who is exploited or excluded through these tools or structures?” (Okune et al., 2018, p. 12)

- In the design of KIs, OS tends to overlook
	- the importance of Social Infrastructures and 
	- systemic constraints 
- Negotiation and translation with a wide array of actors
- Mind diversity of human needs, identities, abilities, experiences and forms of knowing. 
- Users and creators have "complex, heterogeneous and (at times) conflicting needs and identities" that need to be part of the design process
- Expand our thinking: what constitutes infrastructures? 
	- More than technical 
	- Human-centered design

“...[it is key to recognize] complex identities, histories, cultures and diverse forms of expression as invaluable for creating knowledge infrastructures that are deliberatively and constructively inclusive” (Okune et al., 2018, p. 14)

## Memory, Truce, and Target

1. **Memory**: store, access, and situate events in larger trends. 
	1. No data is ever definitive. 
	2. <mark>**Consistency** is crucial for memory-building</mark>
	3. New observers, new methods, changes in political systems
2. **Truce**: alliances for sustained cooperation. 
	4. Acts of dealing with conflict and differences. 
	5. Reconciling differences. 
    
3. **Target**: routine as goals.
	1. Make technology perform specific actions.
	2. *Things to shoot at*: alter balance between 
	   crisis/problems <-> publics/constituency <-> theory/solution

## Challenges to environmental data infrastructure 

- Implications: if foundational data is not collected there is no debate, irreversible gaps in long-term environmental records, limitations in detection + response
- Post 2000 target on routines and truces (consensus)
- Audit culture: open _black boxes_ and appeals for transparency
- Outcomes: challenging platforms reinforced consensus.
    
- Some skeptics changed views (others did not)
    
- Audits are just one part of the issue:
    
    - Industry (fossil-fuel, mostly) supports these attacks.
        
    - Think tanks play a key role as institutional support for skeptics.
        
- Alter the balance with other explanations

## Infrastructure as *sunken* resources  💰🏗

- Infrastructure *sunks* design into other structures (social and technical) so things do not need to *be repeated every time*. 
- Robust Networks (people, tech, and institutions) need
    
- Routine, reliable, widely accepted knowledge is not forever.
    
- Balance needs to be also maintained

## New Fronts in the Siege: From targeting outputs to eliminating inputs
_From Edwards (2019)_

#### The 2017 Escalation 

- Federal Administration: tactics shifted to a more direct attack on infrastructure (instead of audits and *discredit*)
    
- New approach: target knowledge infrastructures (satellites and data) rather than just outputs

#### From Outputs to Inputs: A Strategic Shift
- **PAST STRATEGY**: Question conclusions, data analysis, uncertainty estimates
    
- **NEW STRATEGY**: Delete instruments and data collection capabilities

## Changes: targets and strategies (2017) 🎯

#### New targets

- Instruments required to track environmental change
- Climate change missions within government agencies
- Funding for environmental data collection and analysis
    
- Access to existing climate data
    

#### Contrasting strategies 

- Earlier "audits" challenged knowledge after production
- Current attacks prevent knowledge production at the source (data generation + retrieval)
- Represents a more fundamental threat to the stability of environmental + climate knowledge infrastructure
    
- Data that doesn't exist cannot be challenged (nor used for )

## Responding

1. What is the future of environmental science, data, and policy in *anti-science* and *anti-environmental administration?* 
2. **Response**:
	1. Archiving (web pages and scientific data)
	2. Monitoring changes to Web Sites
	3. Interviewing staff 
	4. Analyze shifts in Environmental Policy
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

#### Executive branches can actively challenge and undermine support for environmental knowledge infrastructures.  

Let's think deeper about responses: 

1. Which of these strategies do you think is most resistant to political interference?
2. How are digital technologies transforming the ability to preserve environmental data?
3. How would you leverage these components in larger responses? 
4. What do you think is the role of so-called "social infrastructures" in these efforts? 
   SI: networks, interpersonal relationships, practices, and collaborative experiences that produce and share knowledge (beyond technical components)
5. What, then, should be the role of environmental knowledge and data should keep playing? Document harm? Guide transformation?

## A critique of state science
- Data never presents *unambiguous* forms of truth. 
	- It is not *truth* vs. *fiction* (it is never a complete representation).
	- Defense cannot be *uncritical* (focused on facts and data). 
- Regulatory state: *damage-centered* science (documenting harm + pathologize communities ↔ perils of portrayal)
- *Environmental Data Justice* 

> "...building alternative social and technical data infrastructures and more just socio-environmental futures" (Dillon et al., 2019, p. 546)

## Damage and Desire

- Environmental Data has dangers (perils of portrayal: inequality, stigma, flattening complexity, limits to constructive engagement, misrepresentation, power imbalances)
- Environmental Data Justice focuses on actively using data to build a better world. 

> “Desire-based research does not pathologize communities by merely documenting harm; rather, it emphasizes capacities, multiplicities, and hope and actively works toward building a better world” (Dillon et al., 2019, p. 546)

## Environmental Governance and "Alternative Facts"

- The problem of a "malleable reality". 
	- The distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, blurs to disappear (until events happen)
	- Erosion of standards, of *truces* that produce knowledge, limits responses (and governance)
	- Evidence-based policymaking becomes 
- Threats: resource reduction (defunding, institutional capacities), openness as a tool for limiting evidence (transparency and reproducibility demands), barriers to data access (paywalls, permissions, reduced findability), lack of context (essential metadata, documentation, raw numbers, and no framework), reduced visibility (no public scrutiny)

## Beyond a simplistic narrative

- It is not about persons and *personalities*.
- Skepticism (it is not just *true* or *false*, but rather, *What does it opaque? What does it ignore?*)
- Systematic transformations (agencies priorities, values, services)
- Corporate influence (petrochemical industries) and established histories of "manufacturing doubt."

## A Grassroots Response

- State environmental data integrity is questioned
- Alternative data infrastructures (official sources are compromised)
- Right to know: preservation of the *best evidence available* (that speaks to decision makers)
- Situating data is a way to deal with the imperative of: 

> "How to account for the social construction of knowledge when environmental facts and data are also vital to any hope of state and corporate accountability for environmental harms." (Dillon et al., 2019, p. 548)

--- 
## Two Theoretical Framworks

- **Situated Knowledge (Haraway)**: All knowledge claims are partial, produced through practices that are:
    - Corporeal
    - Social
    - Geographical
    - Technical
- **Strong Objectivity (Harding)**: Strengthening scientific objectivity requires recognizing how:
    - Knowledge practices are shaped by social and geographical conditions
    - Uncriticized cultural assumptions are transported into research results
    - "Strong reflexivity" requires foregrounding sociospatial positionalities

> “I think my problem, and “our” problem, is how to have simultaneously an account of radical historical contingency for all knowledge claims and knowing subjects, a critical practice for recognizing our own “semiotic technologies” for making meanings, and a no-nonsense commitment to faithful accounts of a“real” world. (579)” (Dillon et al., 2019, p. 4)

## Critical Questions for Situating Data
- Where does the research funding come from?
- What information and ideas are included and excluded?
- What assumptions are embedded in knowledge claims?
- Who gets to make valid knowledge claims and through what processes?

--- 
## Benefits of Situating Data

- Strengthens rigor and reflexivity by engaging with the context of knowledge production
- Undermines claims to absolute objectivity while acknowledging the power of data
- Creates space for alternative data practices (e.g., Indigenous data sovereignty)
- Enables reflexive, inclusive, and participatory knowledge making
- Go beyond either/or: 

> “<mark>Situating data undermines any claim to absolute objectivity</mark>—for example, the notion that state data simply reflect “what is”—while also acknowledging the power and potential of grassroots data collection projects (“The Counted”2016; Maharawal and McElroy 2017).” (Dillon et al., 2019, p. 559)

Q: What do you think about this? What happens if an *absolute* objectivity cannot be claimed? What implications can you find for the ways we know things?

## EDJ Framework: Desire-based approach

> "EDGI theorizes environmental data justice as a 'desire-based framework' (Tuck 2009) that seeks to <mark>foster justice, inclusion, and accountability in environmental knowledge practices</mark> (Paris et al. 2017; Walker 2017)."

**Key Principles**
- **Proactive Creation**: practices, technologies, governance models, and infrastructures built to bring about a more just world
- **Justice-Centered**: justice and equity are central to environmental, climate, and data governance
- **Anti-Authoritarian Values**: Commitments to anti-elitist, participatory, and emancipatory approaches that "increase the objectivity of science"
- **Expanded Focus**: Bringing critical data studies into conversation with environmental justice to address data stewardship, technical infrastructures, and coding tools

### Data Stewardship and Custodial Responsibility

This is an example of stewardship taken to the next level, how do you think deals with the following?
- Protecting data assets
- Cultivating good data practices
- Meeting data standards and regulations (which?)
- Maintaining data quality 
- Enhancing access, education and training
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

### Rescue and preservation: ways of *situating data*

- **Community Empowerment**: Not just archiving data, but "empowering a broad community to work together to copy and preserve data they cared about"
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Creating toolkits to enable communities to replicate and build on processes
- **Crediting Collaborators**: Acknowledging both local and nonlocal contributions
- **Decentralized Stewardship**: Limiting the state's power to control or remove datasets
- **Web monitoring**: change over time, particular vulnerabilities of online environmental information to shifts in political power
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

### Beyond Reaction: Positive Visioning

- Not simply reacting to political threats but building something new
- Creating inclusive communities of concern
- Envisioning alternative environmental knowledge and data practices
- Being "in the action, finite and dirty, not transcendent and clean"
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## Final remarks

- **Combining critique with political engagement**
- Developing alternatives when (petrochemical) interests dominate federal environmental agencies
- Responding to threats to regulatory and data infrastructures that vulnerable communities rely on
- Embracing Productive Tensions: theory - action, reflection - change (no easy resolution), support environmental justice. 
- Critique *but* also create.

## Module 5: Key concepts (I)

1. **Open Science:** movement focused on making scientific research, tools, data, and outputs accessible, transparent, collaborative, and reusable; enhances accountability and empowers society by enhancing new uses of tools and data (Leonelli 2023)
2. **Social Infrastructures:** collaborative experiences, practices, interpersonal relationships, and networks that produce and share knowledge beyond technical components. They can complement technical infra (Okune et. al. 2018)
3. **Inclusion and Collaboration** (in the design of KIs): users from minorities and with intersectional identities tend to be excluded from Knowledge Infrastructure Design (Okune et. al. 2018)
4. **Data Governance**: legal, technical, and organizational frameworks used to determine who can use, store, and share data. What can be used  (Guest Lecture by Emelia W.) 
5. **Data Stewardship:** sustained and responsible management of data assets throughout their lifecycle so they remain usable, accessible, and consistent. It involves operations at the technical level and the social-organizational level (data practices, compliance with standards and regulations, maintenance, documentation, user training, etc.)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## Module 5: Key concepts (II)
1. **Memory**: function of data and data models to store, access, and situate events in larger trends; consistency is crucial (especially in a context of rapid environmental change)
2. **Truce**: alliances and agreements for sustained cooperation in which differences are reconciled and consensus is reached, allowing data to be shared meaningfully. 
3. **Target**: routines are patterns for new technologies and systems; they can also be "targeted" when the systems that produce, maintain, and disseminate scientific knowledge are eroded by direct (defund, deletion) and indirect (audits, skepticism) means. (Edwards 2019; Dillon et al. 2019)
4. **Memory-truce-target**: there is an aggregated relation between these three concepts, it serves to explain how and why KIs function, persist, and, in given situations, can become vulnerable. 
5. **Maintenance:** a critical stage in the life of technologies (innovation, maintenance, decay); the set of practices and work required to sustain KIs, so they remain functional over time. It maintains consistent and reliable environmental data, reacting to changes in the context (observers, organizations, methods, standards, technologies, etc.) (Vinsel & Russell 2020; Edwards 2019)
6. **Situating Data**: acknowledging the context in which data is produced, preserved, and interpreted. Rigor is supported through reflexivity about the limits of knowledge (knowledge is produced through specific corporeal, social, geographical, and technical practices) and the role-specific positionalities (social, spatial, cultural) that shape knowledge practices (Dillon et al. 2019, citing Haraway and Harding)

### Situating Knowledge: Insurance, Risk, and Climate Change

Some of the uses of Data in Corporate Sustainability:

1. Sustainability reporting (assessment)
2. Carbon Accounting (emissions, carbon accounting, carbon offsets, GHG supply chain inventories)
3. Product Design and Marketing (greenwashing -- greenhushing -- greenwishing, sustainability claims)
4. Data to make decisions in a changing world: 
	1. Understand the changes. 
	2. Assess the impact. 
	3. Decision-making (optimization and automation as a goal). 
	4. Business model adaptation. 

*By looking at the way the Insurance Industry is reacting to climate uncertainty and the role of modeling, climate data, and weather observation infrastructure*

## Insuring Climate Change

## How insurance works?

Insurance provides value by transferring risk from policy holders to insurance companies.

1. **Policy holders**: pay premiums, file claims, etc.
    
2. **Insurance companies**: assess risk and determine premium rates, process claims, manage reserves, diversify risk (limit exposure).
    
3. **Reinsurance companies:** take portions of the risk portfolios from insurance companies so they can take larger policies; they estabiize the market.
    
4. **Regulators:** establish rules for policies (terms, pricing, etc.), provide licenses, monitor compliance, enforce solvency and protect consumers.

## Climate Change and Insurance

- Insurance is the industry that most rapidly accepted climate change, is the _mother of all risks._
    
- Natural disasters are changing insurance as environmental risk is **growing**
    
    - Good for business not for citizens (W. Buffet)
        
    - Calls for adaptations in foresight (damage information, implementing risk-reduction).
        
- Anticipation is the key (for insurance and other business)
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="has-dark-background drop" template="" data-background-color="#020A20" -->

## Infrastructural inversion: what is on the background?

- Prices of houses are on the rise since 1980s (except for the financial crisis from 07/08).
    
    - More houses (bigger cities, denser urbanization, more construction).
        
    - Higher and longer mortgages.
        
    - Risk mitigation is transferred through insurance.
        
    - More economic value is at risk; higher are the payouts.
        
- Scenarios:
    
    1. Bankruptcy of the insurance industry (premiums cannot compensate for impact)
        
    2. Exclusionary effects (lower-income households lacking of insurance; inequality increase)

## _Assurantialisation_ and the increase in risk coverage

- Our societies thrived in steady climate conditions (last 10,000 years)
    
- The capitalist expansion was possible, in part, because of insurance techniques.
    
    - Insurance: provides policies.
        
    - Re-insurance: protect insurance companies against risk.
        
- Modern societies cover more and more risks (climate, professional, technological, etc.)
    
- New forms of protection arose (private, public, common)
    
- Today, insurance for natural disasters is rapidly changing: privatization and financialization.

## Changes in the insurance sector

1. Hypercorrelation: non-correlation between risks are dissapearing.
    
    1. Whole territories territories are exposed to climate-related hazards.
        
    2. Compound disasters (Fukushima).
        
2. Insurance companies reduce exposure to risk by diversifiying: turned to financial market (risk derivates) - New layer of risk.
    
3. CatBonds: financialization of nature as “adaptation” to climate risk.
    
4. State: response and recovery, explicit programs for insurance, Sovereigh CatBonds (alternative to last resort insurance)

## Data, insurance and nature

- Agencies, Research and Data Sharing Infrastructures:
    - Create and maintain the geophysicial research infrastructure (satellites, stations, repositories, APIs, etc.)
    - Provide models to calculate probability of events (wind, temperature, etc.)       
- These are critical components that support the rising industry of climate modeling ([$4 billion by 2027](https://www.wtwco.com/en-us/insights/2023/11/a-higher-standard-for-climate-risk-modeling#footnote-10:~:text=As%20a%20result,%5B10%5D.))
    
- Climate intelligence: data, risk models, tailored analyses, and insights to orient response (rising industry)}
- People and institutions need to understand and respond to climate risks.

## Market Disruption
- Insurance companies are rapidly changing operations (see also [here]([https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/opinion/climate-change-homeowners-insurance-housing-market.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/opinion/climate-change-homeowners-insurance-housing-market.html))): increased climate exposure, regulatory constraints, and pulling out coverage. 
	- High-risk states
	- High-risk zones 
	- Poor Payouts - Premium ratio
- Premiums are getting more expensive; rising insurance costs are affecting mortgages. 
- "Last resort" insurers are taking bigger portions of the market (e.g. Florida)

## Risk Assessment Models
- Models reduce complexity and facilitate understanding, translating information to actionable insight (Module 3)
- FSF-WFM model provides property-specific risk estimates
- First Street Model: democratizes climate risk information through *Risk Factor* (tm)
- Forecasting: 30 years into the future. 
- Property values will shift (wins and losses)
- Financial consequences (personal, local taxes)
- Migration flows (time, information availability, socio-economic means)

## Assignment


We will engage in a role-playing exercise. We want to explore how stakeholders view, use, and value climate data and climate risk modeling in the house and insurance market. Make groups, and choose one of these stakeholders. For local actors, we will focus on affected areas.

- Homeowners (Primary residents)
- Investment property owners
- Homeowner associations 
- Local government officials
- State government representatives
- Financial investors/insurers
- Climate data analytics companies

## Assignment
Discuss the following questions (choose those that matter the most) from your stakeholder's perspective:

1. **Applications of Climate Risk Models**
    - What specific uses for climate risk models are in your line of work?
    - How would this information influence your decisions related to housing or insurance?
    - What level of detail/specificity would be most valuable to you?
2. **Model Acceptance & Credibility**
    - What would make specific climate risk models more trustworthy from your perspective?
    - What concerns might you have about relying on these models?
    - What would you need to happen for you to act following model predictions confidently? (validations, evidence, alliances, etc.)
3. **Risk Communication & Access**
    - Who should access this information (inside and outside your organization)? Why?
    - Should this information be public, private, or somewhere in between?

Tips: embrace your perspective and your standpoint even if it is not what you would personally do, consider broader impacts and interactions, consider how you would build alliances and consensus with others, and be prepared to defend your position.

- Private companies (e.g. climate intelligence) monetize climate information that was originally developed with public funding ➡ this requires *paywalls* (potentially creating inequalities and enlarging exposition)
- For rapid and decided climate action, we need people to be invested in creating change. 
- **Let's discuss pros and cons of monetizing climate information** (back to groups)
	- Argument in favor. 
	- Argument against (see [this Opinion Piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/opinion/climate-risk-disasters-data.html)).

## Climate data and Investment

- Entrepreneurial State: economic success stems from public and state-funded investments in innovation and technology (Mazzucato 2014). 
	1. Lead risk-taker (investment in innovations + infrastructures)
	2. Public funding supported key innovations (GPS, touch screen technologies, voice recognition, the internet, etc.)
	3. The state, when *proactive*, creates and shapes markets (regulation, protection, etc.)
	4. Trend: socialization of risks and privatization of rewards.
	5. Public Value can be created: timely shared information can save lives.

## Climate Data as a *Common* Good

- Communities are knowledge stewards and can be involved in data gathering processes. 
- This needs to be governed to protect the value communities have created. 
- This is also valid for other communities:
	- Programers writing Free and Open Source Software (*free* as in freedom)
	- Technologist creating hardware to measure. 
- Accounts of histories as practices of *commoning* stress it as a principle for *creating social ties* beyond just management and not related to *markets* or the *state*:

## Sustainability through datafication in *Smart Cities*

In this piece, Alison Powell concludes his book about the shift in the relationship between the power of citizens, government, and corporations as cities become increasingly digital. In the context of the rising climate emergency, the book stresses the shared technical imaginaries through similar argumentation about using digital technologies in cities. In connection to our former discussion, it asks about *who controls* data analytics. This piece interests us in the context of looking at specific sustainability cases, as it entangles the commodification of data, participation, and the multiple roles specific technologies can serve, not just responding to people's needs but also collecting and producing data for other interests. In this passage, she reflects on the relation between present and future uses of data, stressing the concept of minimum viable datafication as a different approach to the logic of optimization.

## Smart Cities as an Extreme Case of Digital Integration

- _Smart cities_ serve as an _extreme case_ for the integration of digital technologies in environmental and physical worlds.
    
- Datafication and is increasingly part of political-economic arrangements.
    
- As data collection expands there is a consolidation of _who controls_ data analytics.
    
- Optimizing works only on one aspect of the system but externalizes costs on people and communities.
    
- Civic voice: can be produced in the gaps of dominant positions
    
    - Know otherwise
        
    - Accept the unknowable (of urban life)
        
- MVD: “collect data to develop functions in the present rather than to intensify future use” (Powell, 2021, page 165)

## Ways you encounter AI in the cities

1. Traffic lights: self-driving cars (Elaine Herzberg; Tempe, AZ, 2018) cameras detecting speed, technology for optimal speed (Glosa)
2. Lampposts: cameras, sensors, AI-enabled equipment:
> The cameras in the lampposts, they do not communicate with us, they are above our heads, literally, they communicate with elsewhere [...] These boxes are not giving anything, they are just extracting. They seem designed not to draw attention to themselves." - Resident in Coventry

3. Billboards: adaptative content:
> "That camera just tells the advertising company in London when the screen goes down. So I often feel that some of the advertising has nothing to do with Edinburgh." - Resident in Edinburgh

4. In/under pavement: sensors to monitor road conditions, sewage systems.
5. In the sky: drone taxis

## Alibaba City Brain

- **Alibaba** 🇨🇳  data-based corporation (Alipay, Aliexpress, etc.)
- Proprietary AI: Video + GPS data (buses, cars) for real-time analysis.
    
- Data governance: unclear; seems like they are accessing vehicle IDs
    
- City data grab: Hangzhou 🇨🇳  + Kuala Lumpur 🇲‍🇾
    - No control on stated and future uses
    - Valuable for profiling and commercial activities
        
    - Mining data using public infrastructure and the public
        
    - Data-hungry AI controls and watches over cities
        
- A centralized system is a liability (hacking, data breaches, etc.)

- Basic premise: urban problems are best addressed using networked data + sensors
    
- (raw material for prediction products sold to businesses and governments)
    
- Re-engineering humanity (Selinger): citizens adapting to algorithmic gov. not systems adapting to citizens

## Rights redefined

- Responses to issues framed to “be computable”
    
    - Normative: transparency and accountability (protected classes, abstraction, contextual integrity, and justice) -> but data is relational, not isolated (data sharing, data breaches)
        
    - Critical: data shift as it moves and establish relationships

## A Minimum Viable Datafication

- Right to privacy: people, groups, places.
    
- Knowledge(s) can belong to a specific place.
    
- Situate citizenship to transcend universals.
    
- Data collection is part of circuits of power and influence, extending data collection constantly serves those interest.
